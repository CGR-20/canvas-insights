<p>Please follow the steps below 10 separate times (I'm asking for 10 videos total)<br>1. Pick one of the topics from the list below<br>2. Find and watch (end-to-end) a 3-10 minute (roughly) video that explains the topic. &nbsp;You can use Youtube, Investopedia, Khan Academy, Linkedin Learning, or whatever else you feel is engaging and reputable. &nbsp;Using a 1-5 star scale, rate them on 1) Informative (helpful and accurate) and 2) Presentation (easy to follow, fun, interesting)<br>3. Rate the videos across two factors: Informative (helpful and accurate) and&nbsp;<br>Presentation (easy to follow, fun, interesting)</p>
<p>So at the end of the semester, you'll have watched 10 videos and each of those videos should have ratings (1-5 stars).</p>
<p>Hint: You may have to tweak your search to find relevant and interesting videos. &nbsp;E.g. ""Least harm ethics"" instead of just ""least harm""</p>
<p>""Do we have to go through every item on the list?""<br>- Nope. &nbsp;You can just pick 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll submit a link to your slide in Canvas, but please get started on it now. &nbsp;Cramming introduces a severe learning risk. &nbsp;Learn more about how [your brain needs time and sleep to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o2yyO0JAes)</p>

<p>There is no Canvas submission.&nbsp; Please show your individual contributions using two annotated screenshots in a shared class Google Presentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Wait... so we have to build an actual business?""<br>- Yes. &nbsp;But I won't fail you if your business fails to bring in revenue</p>
<p>- You can also show substantive evidence of viability (this is the first step to obtaining seed money and Series A funding).&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Does the business have to be in the ethics domain?""<br>- Yes<br>- I'd suggest something that pressures other companies to be more transparent or honest about its dealings. &nbsp;<br>- E.g. a service that pressures companies to be more environmentally friendly (maybe offers a sticker for those that qualify)<br>- E.g. a service that pressures other companies to help someone in need (maybe offering a badge to qualifying companies)<br>- E.g. a service that identifies sex trafficking, drug dealing, money laundering, scams, or other criminal activities&nbsp;<br>- E.g. a Private Investigation service</p>
<p>""Could I help automate some sort of audit process?""<br>- Yes - this would an awesome service. &nbsp;I'd highly recommend this function.</p>
<p>""How do audits work?""<br>- An audit is often one person (or machine) who digs into another company's operations and tries to find unethical and/or illegal things</p>
<p>""Who would define the audit criteria?""<br>- You. &nbsp;Or I'm fine with you partnering with whoever.</p>
<p>""And if this turns out to make money or become my full time job, does Kingsford or UVU get any of the money?""<br>- No</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,100.0,"['online_text_entry', 'online_url']"

Achilles Paradox states that Achilles was asked to catch a slow-moving tortoise which had a head-start crawling away from Achilles. If Achilles wants to catch the tortoise, he needs to first run to where the tortoise is at the present time. Once he runs to where the tortoise was, the tortoise will be at a new location. Therefore, Zeno concluded that Achilles will never catch up to the tortoise.</p><h3><strong>Initial Post</strong></h3><p>We know the conclusion of the Achilles paradox contradicts our common sense. Why does Zeno's argument reach a conclusion that contradict the fact? Your initial post should be a few sentences long to reason whether Zeno's argument was correct. If you argue that it is correct then you need justify why the conclusion contradict the fact. If you argue that Zeno's argument was invalid then show where the mistakes are in his argument.</p><h3><strong><span title="""">Peer Response</span></strong></h3><p><span title="""">After you post you will then see your peers responses.

In a set, we don't list the multiple occurrences of an element. For example, {1, 1, 2, 3} is the same as {1, 2, 3}. In the upcoming chapters, we will present the concept of multisets. A multiset is like a set except it allows for multiple occurrences of the same element. In multisets, {1, 1, 2, 3} is different from {1, 2, 3}.</p><h4><strong>Example</strong></h4><p>Here is an example that illustrates the difference of using sets versus multisets. I went to the grocery store and bought two apples and three oranges. If I am only interested in the items that I purchased, I will use a set with two elements, {apple, orange}. However, if I am interested in the detailed list of everything that I bought, I will use a multiset with five elements, {apple, apple, orange, orange, orange}.</p><h3><strong>Initial Post</strong></h3><p>Create a multiset (like the example above) from something that you use in your everyday life. Your multiset must demonstrate the appropriate usage of sets and multisets to model/represent data.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong><span title="""">Peer Response</span></strong></h3><p>After you post you will then see your peers responses.

The first person to comment will choose one or the other, the next person to comment will choose the opposite, then the next person will choose the opposite of the last comment. Nobody can choose the same advantages or disadvantages that someone else has already used. <strong><em>FOR EXAMPLE:</em></strong> Mike is the first person to comment on this discussion and posts the advantages, Saul is the next person to comment so he must post the disadvantages, Kate is the 3rd person to comment and she must post the advantages (the advantages cannot be the same advantages that Mike has already posted), Gus is the 4th person to comment and he must post the disadvantages (again it cannot be the same disadvantages that Saul already posted), and the rest of commenting will go so forth until everyone in your group has posted a new advantage or disadvantage.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong><span title="""">Grading</span></strong></h3><div id=""flexContainer""><div id=""wide""><p>This discussion is worth a total of 15 points.</p><ul><li>15 points for initial post.</li></ul><p>See the grading rubric for more details on how you will be assessed by 1) clicking on the options icon and 2) selecting ""Show Rubric.""</p><p>There is no late submission after the ""until"" day.

</math>"">Mary means John follows Mary on Twitter. This ""follow"" relation is not reciprocal, i.e., ""John follows Mary"" does not imply ""Mary also follow John"". An undirected graph can be used to model the FaceBook friend relation. For example, John — Mary means John and Mary are friends with each other.

<p><strong>Group Project Milestone 1:</strong></p>
<p>For this milestone, you'll be turning in a <strong>Project Launch Details</strong> document that you'll prepare with your team.&nbsp; The document will contain the following:</p>
<p><strong>List of Team members</strong></p>
<p><strong>Proposed Meeting schedule</strong> (must meet at least once a week outside of class throughout the semester, but can be more as needed -- meetings can be in person or remote over Zoom or MS Teams.&nbsp; Note that talking together for 5 minutes in the classroom before class starts is not a ""meeting"", but an organized sit-down meeting immediately before or after class time is fine.)</p>
<p><strong>Schedule of Scrum Masters</strong> (each team member must be scrum master for a ""sprint"" at least once during the semester -- a ""sprint"" will be the time period in between project milestones, every 2-3 weeks)</p>
<p><strong>Programming Language</strong> your team will use for project (note that anything other than C#, C++, Java, or Python will need instructor permission)</p>
<p><strong>Source Control</strong> (what your team will use for central repository for code or other project files -- GitHub, Visual Studio Version Control, or something similar.&nbsp; I would recommend using something that has version control, not just a cloud storage folder)</p>
<p><strong>Project Management</strong> -- what your team will use for task management, to-do lists, and other project specific details (may be the same as the source control option).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, note that all ""official"" meetings of your team should have a <strong>Meeting Report</strong> which outlines: who attended, agenda items you discussed, action items for each team member to work on before next meeting.&nbsp; &nbsp;You'll be turning in all your meeting reports during each milestone in addition to the specific milestone requirements.&nbsp; I'd encourage the assigned scrum master for each sprint to take the lead in preparing the meeting agenda ahead of each meeting to make your meetings more structured and productive, then just take notes during the meeting on your existing agenda docs and turn those in as your meeting reports.</p>
<p>For submission:&nbsp; each team member should submit the group Project Launch Details document described above as their submission for this assignment (this is how I will know that each team member has been participating in the preparation with the team so far).&nbsp; &nbsp;One chosen team representative will also submit the meeting report(s) for each team meeting before the milestone due date (this will be the scrum master in future milestones, but pick one representative for the meeting reports this milestone, no need for every team member to submit the meeting reports).</p>
<p>Grading: 35 points for Project Launch Details document, 5 points for one or more meeting reports from this milestone period&nbsp;</p>

<p>An important and influential educational client has hired your company to develop a software simulator called UVSim for computer science students to learn machine language and computer architecture. Students can execute their machine language programs on the simulator.</p>
<p>The UVSim is a simple virtual machine, but powerful. The UVSim can only interpret a machine language called BasicML.</p>
<p>The UVSim contains CPU, register, and main memory. An accumulator – a register into which information is put before the UVSim uses it in calculations or examines it in various ways. All the information in the UVSim is handled in terms of words. A word is a signed four-digit decimal number, such as +1234, -5678. The UVSim is equipped with a 100-word memory, and these words are referenced by their location numbers 00, 01, ..., 99. The BasicML program must be loaded into the main memory starting at location 00 before executing. Each instruction written in BasicML occupies one word of the UVSim memory (instruction are signed four-digit decimal number). We shall assume that the sign of a BasicML instruction is always plus, but the sign of a data word may be either plus or minus. Each location in the UVSim memory may contain an instruction, a data value used by a program or an unused area of memory. The first two digits of each BasicML instruction are the operation code specifying the operation to be performed.</p>
<p>BasicML vocabulary defined as follows:</p>
<p>I/O operation:<br>READ = 10 Read a word from the keyboard into a specific location in memory.<br>WRITE = 11 Write a word from a specific location in memory to screen.</p>
<p>Load/store operations:<br>LOAD = 20 Load a word from a specific location in memory into the accumulator.<br>STORE = 21 Store a word from the accumulator into a specific location in memory.</p>
<p>Arithmetic operation:<br>ADD = 30 Add a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator)<br>SUBTRACT = 31 Subtract a word from a specific location in memory from the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator)<br>DIVIDE = 32 Divide the word in the accumulator by a word from a specific location in memory (leave the result in the accumulator).<br>MULTIPLY = 33 multiply a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator).</p>
<p>Control operation:<br>BRANCH = 40 Branch to a specific location in memory<br>BRANCHNEG = 41 Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is negative.<br>BRANCHZERO = 42 Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is zero.<br>HALT = 43 Pause the program</p>
<p>The last two digits of a BasicML instruction are the operand – the address of the memory location containing the word to which the operation applies.</p>
<p><strong>What you'll be submitting:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Design Document</strong> (20 pts) -- document that describes the high-level functionality of your application. &nbsp;Your document will need at least 2 User Stories and 10-15 use cases outlining the functionality of your application. &nbsp;(Ranges here are deliberate to avoid making your use cases too broad or too narrow.)</p>
<p><strong>Working Prototype</strong> &nbsp;(40 pts) -- prototype of your application that works from the command line -- it should ask for an input file and then process that file (using the console for any input/output specified by the file contents itself).&nbsp; This is a prototype, so code it with an eye towards getting it working first, but also with an eye towards (as yet unknown) future expansion. &nbsp;ALL team members must contribute to the code base -- you will need to submit a link to your source control base (or a screenshot from your source control that shows that all team members have checked in code for your project).</p>
<p><strong>Unit Tests</strong> (30 pts) -- each use case should have two unit tests (so 20-30 total) to test the functionality of each use case (you can have more if you deem it suitable for that use case -- remember that unit tests in general need to test both the success condition(s) for each function as well as all possible failure conditions as well.). &nbsp; The code for the unit tests should also be part of your source control code base.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You will also create a spreadsheet that lists the unit tests in row/column form. &nbsp;Give each unit test a name, short description, the reference to the appropriate use case, inputs, expected outputs, and how you know whether the test succeeded or failed.</p>
<p><strong>Other Documents</strong> (10 pts) -- Create a README.txt text file that describes how to use your application from the command line. &nbsp;The grader should not need any information outside of your README to understand how to launch and use your application.&nbsp; Make sure you note here if the programming language you used for the project requires some prerequisites to be installed ahead of time in order for your project to run. In addition to README, also submit your meeting reports from this sprint.</p>

<p>Your submissions for this milestone:</p>
<p><strong>Modifications from previous milestone (10 pts):</strong> in your feedback to the previous milestone, I should have given you an indication if any of the user stories / use cases or code your team submitted needed additions or modifications.&nbsp; &nbsp;Edit your document and/or source code to fulfill those requests and resubmit with the given changes for these points.&nbsp; (If the feedback indicated that no changes were necessary, you'll have these points automatically)</p>
<p><strong>GUI Design Document (10 pts):</strong> As part of your project revision, you'll need to discuss and design as a team how you want your user interface to work.&nbsp; Create a ""wireframe"" diagram of your GUI that shows in basic form how it will look and how it will work.</p>
<p><strong>Code Changes (35 pts)</strong>: After you've designed your GUI, implement it in your code base.&nbsp; Make sure it meets common-sense standards of ""user-friendliness"" (proper labelling of controls, proper workflow -- you'll want to discuss this as part of your functional requirements below).&nbsp; &nbsp;Note that depending on how you constructed your code for the previous milestone, you may need to redo parts of your original code to support the GUI layer.&nbsp; &nbsp;(This is common with most prototypes that show proof-of-concept but some/all of the code ends up getting 'thrown away' when design revisions are made.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Class Definition Document</strong><strong> (15 pts): </strong>Describe all of the classes in your project, including interfaces, base classes, and abstract classes.&nbsp; &nbsp;Make sure your class design is properly modular with loose coupling (i.e. no user interface code in the data model classes or ""business logic"" classes.&nbsp; Proper class design should also make sure classes are divided appropriately without one class becoming too big or unwieldy.&nbsp; (If you have a class that has more than five fields and/or ten functions it is probably a good candidate to subdivide into multiple classes).&nbsp; In your document, each class should have additional documentation for the following: purpose of the class, purpose of each function, description of any input parameters for the function, description of return value (if any), pre- and post-conditions for the function.</p>
<p><strong>Software Requirement Specification (SRS) Documents (20 pts):</strong> Submit the 7-8 SRS documents as defined by the process below.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other Documents (10 pts):</strong> Submit a revised README.txt describing how the grader can use your GUI to perform operations.&nbsp; Also submit any meeting reports from this sprint.</p>
<p>Software Requirement Specification Document format:</p>
<p>1. Each team member (without consulting with other team members) will create their own SRS document containing 15 functional requirements and 3 non-functional requirements.</p>
<p>2. Submit these documents WITHOUT NAMES to the scrum master assigned to this sprint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The scrum master will divide the team into two groups and assign half of the documents to each team.</p>
<p>4. Each sub-team will discuss the documents they've been given and ""merge"" them into one document.&nbsp; (The merged documents should still have at least 15 functional requirements and 3 non-functional requirements in the end, but can have more if you find that the submitted requirements are distinct and valuable enough apart from each other.&nbsp; Don't just copy and paste one into another, though -- you'll need to discuss how to add/combine/rewrite the contents of both files to create the new one so it is internally consistent without repeats, redundancy, or contradiction between all the requirements.)</p>
<p>5. Each sub-team submits their merged document back to the scrum master.</p>
<p>6. As a team, meet and examine the resulting documents, and create one final SRS document based on your group's discussion and feelings about the results of the previous exercises.&nbsp; (The resulting final document should have at least the same 15/3 content as before after any merging/rewrites, but can have more.&nbsp; As before, make sure your final document is consistent after the merge with no repeats, redundancy or contradictions)</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Submit the final document as well as the 6-7 working documents created in the earlier steps.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,100.0,['online_upload']

<p><strong>Revisions To Previous Milestone (10 pts)</strong>:&nbsp; In the feedback for the previous milestone, I should have given you indications about revisions to your previous document or submissions.&nbsp; Make those modifications and resubmit for these points.&nbsp; (If my feedback says your submissions needed no changes, you will have these points automatically).</p>
<p><strong>New Design Modifications (80 pts):&nbsp;</strong> Your client likes the application so far, but has some new feature requests (read: new requirements):&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The current interface should be 'branded' with the appropriate color scheme, with the default being the UVU colors.&nbsp; &nbsp;Furthermore, the color scheme should be configurable by the user without needing to recompile and reinstall the app.&nbsp; &nbsp;Set up a system where the user can configure a color scheme (one primary color, and one 'off-color') and have the app (either instantly or upon restart) start using that custom color scheme.&nbsp; (You can do this inside the app somewhere, or through a configuration text file containing the color info that is read on startup).&nbsp; &nbsp;You can decide whether to use RGB or Hex values for the colors -- UVU uses a dark green that's RGB (76,114,29) / Hex# 4C721D with white (255,255,255 / #FFFFFF) as the off-color.&nbsp; You can decide how and where to add the color to your interface, making sure that it is still readable and usable.&nbsp; Text can still be black or dark gray.</li>
<li>Currently, if there's an issue with the file input (even a single byte) the process has to be recreated and redone.&nbsp; The request now is that your application supports loading in the file first to the GUI in such a way that the command order can be inspected and modified before execution with the ability to add, modify, and delete commands through the GUI.&nbsp; &nbsp;The client wants to be able to cut, copy, and paste as well as make individual manual changes to the code sequences. (NOTE that the max size of the data (100 entries: #00 - #99) cannot change, so don't allow add or paste operations that would exceed the max size.)</li>
<li>The client wants to be able to save and load files from any user-specified folder (not just a fixed default system folder).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that for these functional changes you'll need to modify (and resubmit) not just the source code, but all of the associated design documents and elements that are affected by these changes:&nbsp; unit tests, use cases, requirements, changes to GUI wireframe, class diagrams, and your README instructions for the grader.&nbsp; All aspects of your project should be up to date with the current state of your working application.</p>
<p><strong>Other Documents (10 pts):</strong> Submit your meeting reports for this sprint as well.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,100.0,['online_upload']
556418,6592032,Group Project Milestone 5,"<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118710790/canvas_global_app.css""><p>Your next meeting with the client goes well: ""We love it...we just need some more features!""</p>
<ul>
<li>The scope of each processed file is judged to be too small:&nbsp; expand the application so it can handle 250 line files, instead of 100.&nbsp; Note that this will require the support of three-digit line #'s instead of two (although you do not have to support more than 250 lines -- any command that references a line # greater than 249 will be invalid).&nbsp; Note that to support this, the last digits to handle the address or value portion will need to be expanded to accept three digit values as well -- thus the final processing word for each line will now be 6 digits instead of 4 (and you will now handle 6 digit values for memory registers and math values).&nbsp; &nbsp;The function codes for each operation will not change: simply append a zero to the beginning of each functional code (i.e. 010 instead of 10 will represent a READ command here) using this 6 digit format.</li>
<li>NOTE: With the above expansion, as a team you should decide how to support ""old"" files (4 digit word files): pick one of the following -- support both ""old"" and ""new"" files (you'll have to come up with a way to differentiate them at load or run time, but be able to edit/run them both in your app), or support a one-way ""conversion"" process feature where you can take a 4-digit file and convert it to six digit form (with leading zeroes) and save it to a ""new"" file format for execution.</li>
<li>The application should allow multiple files to be opened in the application at once (you can decide on the implementation -- GUI tabs, sub-windows, or other options, but the client should be able to have multiple files open simultaneously within your app instance, with the ability to edit and/or execute each of those files within the app with the same features as the previous milestone.)</li>
</ul>
<p>As before, these functional changes will require revisions to the source code, unit tests, class diagrams, functional specifications, and README instructions.</p>
<p>Submit these new documents and code along with any meeting records from this period.</p>
<p>Grading will be the same as earlier milestones:</p>
<p><strong>10 points</strong>:&nbsp; Any feedback or requests from the previous milestone that you need to change</p>
<p><strong>80 points</strong>: Functional changes to code and documents as outlined above</p>
<p><strong>10 points</strong>: Meeting reports from this sprint.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,100.0,['online_upload']
556418,6592034,Final Group Project Submissions,"<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118710790/canvas_global_app.css""><p>Final submission time!</p>
<p>No new features this time around, so your source code and unit tests should already be in good shape!</p>
<p>Two major submissions to complete your final meeting with your client.</p>
<p><strong>Client Presentation Video</strong>:</p>
<p>You'll be making a presentation to the client where you discuss and demo your application (assume this presentation will be to higher-level executives that have not been active in the development meetings before now, so have not seen your application before).&nbsp; &nbsp;Rather than a live presentation to the class, your team will create a presentation video recorded by your team as if you were presenting to the client.&nbsp; (Note that you can record individual sections and edit them together for the final submission video, you don't need to perform and record the entire thing ""live"" -- practice it and make sure you get an effective recording that puts your project and team in the best light for your current or future clients).</p>
<p>The content and organization of the presentation will be up to your team, but can contain some coherent combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project introduction / explanation (why does it exist, and what problem is it supposedly solving?)</li>
<li>Overview of the development process (you can introduce your team here and outline how the process went -- who worked on what, etc)</li>
<li>Application demo (make sure you hit all the features that were specifically requested by the client in the previous milestones)</li>
<li>Roadmap for future (see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>All team members need to participate in the presentation in some fashion.&nbsp; The final video should be 10-15 minutes in length (no shorter or longer) and can include Powerpoint slides as well as the project demo (or any other media elements you think would make an effective presentation).&nbsp; If you decide to assign out sections of the video to different team members to record, then edit them together afterwards, make sure there aren't any contradictions or redundancies between sections -- act as if you were still making the presentation live by taking turns, and the script / flow of the presentation should make sense in that context.</p>
<p><strong>Final Project Submission Document</strong></p>
<p>Compile all of your previous documentation into one final document that you'll submit to the client:</p>
<ul>
<li>User stories / use cases</li>
<li>Functional specifications</li>
<li>Class diagrams and GUI wireframes</li>
<li>Unit test descriptions</li>
<li>Application instructions (user manual), the contents of the README basically, but formatting in a more formal way (i.e. add some screenshots for the UI descriptions)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, make sure your document has the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover Page</li>
<li>Table of Contents</li>
<li>Introduction / Executive Summary (a couple of paragraphs describing the purpose and content of your project, for executives who may not have followed the development process closely).</li>
<li>Future Road Map (brainstorm some possible directions you could take your application in the future -- new features, additional platform support, etc.)&nbsp; You won't have to support these in code, but I'd like to see some thought put into what else you might do with your app in the future if you had follow-on projects over the next X months or years.&nbsp; &nbsp;Make some new UI mockups as needed to demonstrate your ideas -- you should incorporate your road map into your video presentation above as well and some new design diagrams may be helpful there also.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure your document is formatted properly so it looks like one cohesive document, not a bunch of separate elements pasted together at the last minute.&nbsp; &nbsp;Either PDF or Word format is allowed for the document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Submit both deliverables (along with any final meeting records) for your final project submission.&nbsp; Congratulations for completing your project!</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,100.0,['online_upload']

<p>In this project, you will create an “About Me” web page containing some basic info about you.</p>
<p>This assignment is meant to be a bit tedious.&nbsp; There are a <u>lot</u> of little parts to it. In order to really learn HTML you have to spend time with it.&nbsp; That means doing a lot of stupid tedious stuff.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Try and have fun with it.</p>
<p>A significant part of this assignment will be looking up the various HTML elements on the web.&nbsp; As a web developer, you need to get used to Googling stuff.&nbsp; Certain things you’ll need to know off the top of your head, but you’ll find yourself looking things up constantly.</p>
<p>A good place to start is w3schools:&nbsp; <a href=""http://w3schools.com"">http://w3schools.com</a>.&nbsp; Look for their HTML tutorial (If you can’t find it on their website, I bet Google can).</p>

</li>
</ol>
<h3>Class Schedule (30 pts)</h3>
<p>For the Class Schedule I want you to create a table that shows your weekly class schedule. This is easy to do using table elements, but it does require some attention to detail.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ol>
<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ol style=""list-style-type: upper-alpha;"">
<li>Make a level-2 header titled “class schedule”</li>
<li>Create a table with 6 columns.</li>
<li>Set the border size to 1, so I can see the borders for each cell. Set the cell spacing to 3, and set the cell padding to 3.</li>
<li>The header row should have a blank cell, followed by cells for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. If you have a Saturday class (you poor soul), you can add a sixth column (or not, I don’t care, really).</li>
<li>Going down the left side of the table, I want you to list out the hours of your week-day in 30-minute increments. You can start as early as you feel necessary.</li>
<li>List the classes you have as cells. Use the row-span element to block out as many 30-minute cells as you need for each item.&nbsp; If you have stuff that starts at an odd time, then guess.&nbsp; I won’t care, as long as it doesn’t look all wonky.</li>
<li>Fill up your schedule. Make stuff up if you have to.&nbsp; I want to see at least four classes that run M-W-F or Tu-Th or every weekday.&nbsp; In addition to classes, You can put your employment, your work-out time, your commute time, or anything else you like.</li>
<li>Use the rowspan attribute, so if you have an hour-long class, the cell should take up two rows, without a line between them.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>EXTRA ITEMS (5 Required, 10 pts max)</h3>
<p>Do any five of the following things.&nbsp; You will need to find this stuff out for yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ol>
<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ol style=""list-style-type: upper-alpha;"">
<li><strong>(2 points) Can you set a repeating background image?</strong> The text should still be readable.&nbsp; Pick something that doesn’t make my eyes bleed, or I won’t give you credit.</li>
<li><strong>(2 points) can you change the font</strong> used in the body of the document to something besides Times New Roman (or whatever your browser uses by default)?</li>
<li><strong>(2 points) can you make your photo right-aligned</strong> on the page, and make the page’s text flow around it?</li>
<li><strong>(2 points) on all hyperlinks,</strong> can you make it so that the underline only appears when you mouse-over the link?</li>
<li><strong>(2 points) find a way to indent your poem</strong>, or center it on the page.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly Schedule </strong>
<ol style=""list-style-type: upper-roman;"">

<li><strong>(2 points) on your weekly schedule, can you fill in in each block</strong> so that each thing is color-coded in its own color (English is yellow, calculus is light red, work is light blue, etc)?</li>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When doing your weekly schedule, make sure your table doesn’t show any of the following errors or I will deduct points:</p>

<p>I like writing.&nbsp; I started about 11 years ago, after I moved to Utah.&nbsp; I’ve won a few minor awards, but right now I don’t have a lot of time.&nbsp; I’ve completed one novel and three short stories.&nbsp; Two of my short stories took Honorable Mention with the L. Ron Hubbard Writers of the Future contest.</p>
<p>I also like historical european martial arts (HEMA).&nbsp; When I have time I study with a group of HEMA enthusiasts in Provo.&nbsp; We study old manuscripts from the 1300s and 1400s and learn fighting techniques with two-handed longswords.</p>
<p>I also teach college as an adjunct professor for both BYU and UVU.&nbsp; This was an unexpected opportunity, which fell into my lap.&nbsp; It takes a lot of time and it is tough, but I get to work with a lot of people and make friends, and share the things that I’ve learned in my career.</p>

<p>In this project you’ll build upon the “About Me” web page.&nbsp; You’ll create an external CSS document that your page links to, and you’ll use that CSS page to modify the look and feel of your document.&nbsp; Featured in this spec are pictures and example from Tom Abbott, a former adjunct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Required work (80 points total)</h1>
<p>This portion is worth 80% of your grade.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Use an external .css file. All CSS should live in this file.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Your .css file must live its own folder. I suggest you name it ./styles, or ./css</li>
<li>In your HTML, you may use the class attribute, only. You may not use the style attribute.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Body (15 points)</h2>
<h3>Font</h3>
<p>Set a font for the body.&nbsp; I’ll take off points if you use Times New Roman.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The font should be readable, so don’t use fancy fonts. Jokerman looks good for headings and the like, but <u>nobody</u> wants to read a page full of the stuff.&nbsp; Pick something that’s meant to be used for reading.&nbsp; Suggestions are Segoe UI, Tahoma, Arial, etc.&nbsp; You can use a serif font if you like, just pick something besides Times New Roman.</li>
<li>The font size should not be larger than 12 point.</li>
<li>Separate your paragraphs visually. You can do this by:
<ul>
<li>Using a first-line indent, like in books.</li>
<li>Add vertical spacing between paragraph (go read something on cnn.com for how this should look). You can do this by adding a margin-bottom or margin-top rules to the &lt;p&gt; element.&nbsp; Your spacing should be about 75% - 100% the font size used for paragraphs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Setting the margin property on the &lt;body&gt; element adjusts the margin around the edge of the window. By default every page has a margin of 15 pixels.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Set a background image</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go through the tutorial on CSS backgrounds at W3Schools: <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp"">http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your Name (10 points)</h2>
<p>Your name should appear at the top in a manner that it catches the eye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a special font (see the “Bonus work” section, below).</li>
<li>Make the font extra-large (30pt)</li>
<li>Put an underline beneath it.</li>
<li>Have your name set in a header that uses some type of background header graphic or gradient. You can do this lots of ways.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>One way is to create a CSS class for &lt;h1&gt;, and set the background-image The background image will appear only within the rectangular space for the &lt;h1&gt;.</li>
<li>Instead of using an &lt;h1&gt;, create an image that has your name and whatever background you like. Put the &lt;img&gt; element at the top of your page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Be creative!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Your portrait (20 points)</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a good photo:</p>
<p><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/544408/files/112626224/preview?verifier=uChcAZoSZVBSp57SNXlWdJd0vOm6hik2K6VFYskj"" alt=""Picture1.png"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/544408/files/112626224"" data-api-returntype=""File""></p>
<p>Notice the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can see the face clearly, and it looks lifelike.</li>
<li>Not blurry.</li>
<li>Not pixelated.</li>
<li>No jpeg artifacts.</li>
<li>Round things look round (not egg-shaped).</li>
<li>Well-lit. Not too bright or dark.&nbsp; Good contrast.&nbsp; Not washed out.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your portrait should not look pixelated, squashed, stretched, jpeggy, or generally messed up.&nbsp; Find a basic paint program, and make friends with it.&nbsp; Most of the problems I’ve seen are from trying to take a selfie from your phone (which is freaking huge) and then squashing it into a manageable size on your page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will <strong><em><u>not</u></em></strong><u> give you an A</u> if your photo looks like one of these:</p>

<p>Incorporate your portrait into your text in a way that it accentuates uses the space on the page, instead of just looking like something you stuck there.</p>
<p>If you don’t know how to do this, you may try a combination of the following suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Center the photograph.</li>
<li>Use the float: right property to put the image on the right side of the page and have the text wrap around it. Remember that the browser will only wrap text that comes after the &lt;img&gt; tag.</li>
<li>Add a white (or colored) border around your picture. You can do this using the padding</li>
<li>Add a drop-shadow. W3Schools has a sample of how to do this.&nbsp; Play around with it until you find a size and positioning that suites you.&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.asp"">http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.asp</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your &lt;img&gt; element may use only the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>src (for obvious reasons)</li>
<li>class</li>
<li>alt</li>
<li>title</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not use align, center, style, or any other attribute.&nbsp; That’s the 90s way of doing things.&nbsp; All the cool kids today use CSS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Headings (10 points)</h2>
<p>Headings should be called out visually, just like your name.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the margin property to set the space above or below each heading. If you don’t know what to do, make sure each heading has an upper margin of 75% of the heading’s font size, and a lower margin of 10%-33% of the heading’s font-size.&nbsp; Do not use extra blank paragraphs or &lt;br&gt; elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Class schedule (25 points)</h2>
<p>You have a lot of options here, but before you start, you really ought to head over to w3schools and look at their tutorial on CSS and tables: <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp"">http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp</a>.</p>
<p>In general, here is what I want to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Get rid of the border property on your &lt;table&gt; element</strong>. You don’t need this anymore.&nbsp; If you want your table to have borders, use CSS.</li>
<li>
<strong>Each of the items on your schedule should have its own background color</strong>. See the sample document for how to do this.&nbsp; You can get this to work by defining a class for each item on your schedule.&nbsp; In my example I used the background-color and border-color properties, and I picked a border color that was slightly darker than the background.&nbsp; I also set the border-style to solid.</li>
<li>
<strong>The column widths for each day of the week should be equal</strong>. You should be able to do this without adding line-breaks to the text in your &lt;td&gt; elements, or shortening the text.&nbsp; There is a number of ways you can do this.&nbsp; I got it to work by:
<ul>
<li>Make a CSS class for the &lt;table&gt; element, and set the following properties:
<ul>
<li>table-layout: fixed</li>
<li>width: (whatever you want. 600px-900px should be fine)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make a CSS class for each &lt;th&gt; element, and set its width Start with 120px, and play with it till it looks good.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you can also try any combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the header different from the rest of the table. Change the text alignment, the font colors, the background color, etc.&nbsp; The default centered behavior you get with &lt;th&gt; almost never looks good.</li>
<li>Use the padding property to add cell padding so that the text isn’t crammed against the cell borders.</li>
<li>Get rid of cell spacing on the &lt;table&gt; element, by setting
<ol>
<li>border-collapse: collapse;</li>
<li>border-spacing: 0;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Use the border-bottom property and border-color property to draw lines across your table on each 30-minute mark. Pick a light color so that the lines are visible but not too strong.</li>
<li>Put a border around the outside of the table.</li>
<li>Tweak the horizontal or vertical alignment using the text-align and vertical-align</li>
<li>Think of something else. Be creative.</li>
<li>Add a background graphic for the entire table. You will have to play with this to get it to look right.&nbsp; If this doesn’t look good, I won’t be impressed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just do something with your table so it looks better than this:</p>

<h1>Extra Credit Work (20 points max)</h1>
<p>You may do up to four of the following for up to 20 points of extra credit.&nbsp; These topics are your responsibility to learn (remember, Google is your friend).</p>
<ol>
<li>(5 points) Embed your document in a centered &lt;div&gt; that floats over a fixed background, like so: <a href=""http://forgefire.blogspot.com/"">http://forgefire.blogspot.com/</a>. (this is easier than you think).</li>
<li>(5 points) in your class schedule, do alternating striped colors for each row, or for each column (not both).
<ol start=""3"">
<li>Here’s an article on how to do that: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/evenodd.en.html"">https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/evenodd.en.html</a>.</li>
<li>You should have a third color for the table header.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(5 points) CSS3 Web Fonts. W3Schools has an in-depth article on this.
<ol>
<li>You can use fancy fonts for your name at the top of the page, and for the section headings.</li>
<li>If you do a special font for your body text, it must be a font that is easy to read. Please don’t make my eyes bleed.&nbsp; No fancy script fonts, gothic-style fonts, etc.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(10 points) If you click on your portrait, have a larger version appear in a modal &lt;div&gt; (like what Facebook or Twitter does). You’ll need JavaScript to do this, but if you search the web you can find lots of examples on how to do this.&nbsp; Requirements:
<ol>
<li>There should be a close-box in the upper left.</li>
<li>Clicking the close box or clicking anywhere outside the image should make the modal &lt;div&gt; disappear.</li>
<li>While the modal &lt;div&gt; is visible, the page in the background should appear darkened or blurred.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(10 points) artistic merit. Wow me.&nbsp; Think outside the box with the page’s layout, do something totally bold.
<ol>
<li>Put each section in its own floating div. Have each div offset from the left margin or centered horizontally.</li>
<li>Make use of side-bars</li>
<li>Have a header that stays fixed on the page.</li>
<li>It can’t just be one thing (that’s what we call a gimmick). Totally re-arrange your paradigm, but above all, make it attractive.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<strong>DESIGN &amp; PREP</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Before you start coding spend a bit of time conceptualizing and designing your profile:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose an interesting topic of interest that will allow you to be creative</li>
<li>Remember and use the design principles you have learned this semester</li>
<li>Create a 'low definition prototype' of your web site
<ul>
<li>This can be made using
<ul>
<li>3x5 or 5x7 postcards</li>
<li>Wireframe drawings on 8.5x11 sheets of paper
<ul>
<li>'Wireframe' just means rough sketches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use Adobe XD to create an electronic wireframe or clickable prototype of your app.</li>
<li>drawing program of any sort</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your wireframes should convey the overall layout and interaction and flow of your site, including:
<ul>
<li><span>Wireframes showing home page layout</span></li>
<li><span>At least one wireframe indicating how your site may be responsive at a tablet level</span></li>
<li><span>Menu structure (links, buttons, tabs)</span></li>
<li><span>Structure of detail pages</span></li>
<li><span>How and where you will include pictures and videos</span></li>
<li>
<span>Annotations and clarifications where needed, for example, notate some of the css effects or animations you might create (draw borders, shadows etc.).</span>your design should communicate</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">I've uploaded a few examples of a web site design (low def prototype) from a previous class.&nbsp; Check them out for ideas!</span></p>

<p><strong>Grading</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: #ff0000;"">Note:&nbsp; Don't worry about making a full blown design, you will flesh out a lot of details as you build your site.&nbsp; This is 'High Level'</span>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">I don't expect this exercise to take more than 1 - 2 hrs</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">If you have a good crack at it you will do well.&nbsp; If you turn in a few scribbles that don't convey anything, you will get punished.</span></li>

<p>This project will allow you to build a responsive web site using all of the skills you have learned thus far.</p>
<p>The theme of this web site is your choice.&nbsp; Choose a theme or interest of yours that has plenty of content and that would allow you to utilize plenty of CSS skills.&nbsp; You can let your imagination run wild.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WEB SITE ELEMENTS -&nbsp; site </strong>should include the following elements:
<ul>
<li><strong>Overall Layout&nbsp; <span style=""color: #ff0000;""> (Required)</span></strong>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for your overall layout, columns, rows, alignment etc.&nbsp; It is a best practice to use CSS Grid for your overall layout, and Flexbox for layout within the site containers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTML 5 Semantic Tags for your entire layout:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>main, header, section, article, nav, aside, footer, figure, figcaption, detail</p>
</li>
<li>I recommend you start with just the main container tags for your application and then add content after they are placed and working as you desire.&nbsp; Put a background and border on them so you can visualize your layout as you put your CSS Grid and Flexbox containers together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Home Page&nbsp; <span style=""color: #ff0000;"">(Required)</span></strong><br>

<li>You could place your menu in the header if you so choose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Menu <span style=""color: #ff0000;"">(Required)</span></strong>
<ul>
<li>Create a menu and place it in a &lt;nav&gt; element in either the header, or an aside to left of main content<br>
<ul>
<li>This could be a menu which uses&nbsp; 'pills' (buttons), or just plain &lt;a&gt; links.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Menu can be vertical or horizontal</li>
<li>Menu has a <span style=""color: #ff0000;"">minimum of three links</span> to different 'sections' of your site, for example:
<ul>
<li>Home -&nbsp; Link which shows your Home Page content</li>
<li>Contact - Link which shows your contact information</li>
<li>???&nbsp; &nbsp;- link to pages which might contain more detailed information and subsections of your site</li>
<li>Menu actions will hide/show the different sections each whose main content is in tab-panes', one at a time.</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Images
<ul>
<li>Your page must contain images <span style=""color: #ff0000;"">(required)</span>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>At least one with a caption
<ul>
<li>You should enclose this in a <a href=""https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_figure.asp"">'Figure' html5 tag</a>, which also includes a figcaption tag.&nbsp;&nbsp;(required) (-2 if missing)</li>
<li>Extra Credit&nbsp; (+2)&nbsp;Utilize a 'picture' tag with child 'source' tags which show different images based on media query.</li>

<p>This project consists of modifying your Project 3 page as follows:</p>
<h3>Refactor CSS-Fix (20 pts)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Refactor and fix layout issues pointed out in your last submission.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Fix alignment, Grid/Flexbox layout and another CSS issues pointed out by the grader, or any you noticed.</li>
<li>If you are using CSS Grid and Flexbox, allow them to do the 'work'.&nbsp; Don't go setting floats, heights etc. that may interfere.</li>
<li>Make any improvements you wish to make to improve look and feel of site</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Organize and document your CSS file</li>
<li>Make sure it is in a subfolder:
<ul>
<li>css/main.css</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style=""color: #3598db;"">Enter a comment at the top of the main.css page indicating the changes that you addressed</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>CSS Theme (40pts)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Once your CSS styles are cleaned up and under control</li>
<li>Create a style sheet that overrides your main.css and gives your site a new 'theme'.
<ul>
<li>This theme should 'substantially' modify the look and feel of the page, not just change a few colors.</li>
<li>Ideas:
<ul>
<li>change your css grid layout, moving a menu from left to right</li>
<li>change css styles, colors, fonts, background image, gradients etc.</li>
<li>change animations to show a different effect or direction</li>
<li>create a 'Dark' or 'Light' theme</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You override style sheet should only override the styles that you wish to modify.&nbsp; DO NOT REPEAT tags that are not modified.</li>
<li>For basic understanding of CSS Overrides/Themes

<h3>Apply/Toggle Theme (10pts)</h3>
<ul>
<li>You will not be applying the theme by default.&nbsp; You will need to press a link or button to enable it</li>
<li>Create a button or link on your site&nbsp; and attach a click event callback that will:<br>
<ul>
<li>Insert a new 'link' element at the bottom of the head tag referring to your new theme stylesheet ('myThemeName.css')</li>
<li>This will override the styles in your main.css file, which should not be changed or removed!</li>

<p>In this assignment, you will</p>
<ul>
<li>Use CssGrid/FlexBox and javascript to create a 'Visitor' form in which to register site visitors.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You will launch this form similar to your other windows, using a 'hidden' section and menu item called 'Log Visit'.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>You will validate the form entries before 'saving' (we will not save data in this version).&nbsp;</li>
<li>You will hide the form and display a thank you message upon submission.</li>
<li>You will document and clean up file structure for your JS Code</li>
</ul>
<p>Include the following in this iteration:</p>
<h3>Refactor JS-Fix and Document (15 pts)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Refactor and fix any javascript issues pointed out in your last submission.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>If you did not have a single page in which you hide/show each section of content (e.g., you created multiple pages)
<ul>
<li>Please refactor&nbsp; your code so that you are doing so.&nbsp; contact me if you need more info on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>also, see Project 3 spec</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Organize and document your JS Files</li>
<li>Make sure it is in a subfolder:
<ul>
<li>js/main.js</li>

<h3>Visitor Form Validation (70 pts)</h3>
<ul>
<li>TEMPLATE
<ul>
<li>I've provided a <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""https://replit.com/@kjenson/Project5-Visitor-Form-Validation-Template#index.html"" target=""_blank"">starting template here</a> for a visitor form.&nbsp; I've given you the full outline of the code and left you different pieces to implement.
<ul>
<li>Refer to the comments with 'TODO' to see what items you need to implement.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #e67e23;"">This template has been provided as an example you can look at and use for this project. &nbsp;Resist the urge to just copy and paste this code. &nbsp;I would like you to write every line of code yourself in your own project and understand what you are writing!</span><br><span style=""color: #e67e23;"">Make the form I provided, which is ugly by design, look much better!</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You may also refer to the following Repls for help.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Start by making a copy of your Personal Web Site.&nbsp; You will be enhancing the site.<strong></strong><strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Create your Visitor Registration Form</strong>, which may include the following elements:<br>
<ul>
<li><strong>FlexBox Form Layout</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Implement Form using flexbox styles for layout purposes<span style=""color: #e03e2d;""> (required)</span>.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Make it look much better than my template!</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Log Visit Button</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Add a menu item or button to your web site page that opens the form in a hidden section just like I had you do in the last project</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Visitor Form</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Your form should contain the following elements<br>
<ul>
<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ul>
<li>Personal Information Section
<ul>
<li>First, Last name&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><span style=""color: #e03e2d;"">(req, validate using 'checkRequired' function)</span></li>

<li>Use a button with id=""submitBtn"" type='submit', this will cause 'submit' event to fire</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Validation Library</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Create a javascript file, e.g., js/validate.js...&nbsp; This will serve as your validation library.
<ul>
<li>You can utilize the validation.js in the <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""https://replit.com/@kjenson/Project5-Visitor-Form-Validation-Template#index.html"" target=""_blank"">template</a>, but type all of the code yourself, understanding it and testing it as you go</li>
<li>Include your javascript library in your html file</li>
<li>Place your main entry point in main.js (include main.js in your index.html, below the validation.js!):
<ul>
<li>
<div>
<div>
<pre class=""lang-js s-code-block""><code class=""hljs language-javascript""><span class=""hljs-variable language_"">document</span>.<span class=""hljs-title function_"">addEventListener</span>(<span class=""hljs-string"">""DOMContentLoaded""</span>, <span class=""hljs-keyword"">function</span>(<span class=""hljs-params"">event</span>) { &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><span>   initValidation</span><span>(</span><span>""#myform""</span><span>);</span>
});</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your ""initValidation"" function should:
<ul>
<li>Set up validation event callbacks
<ul>
<li>onSubmit - Capture submit event and validate the whole form.
<ul>
<li>Make sure you prevent the default event as well as event bubbling</li>
<li>You can check whether a form is 'valid' you may use the DOM function
<ul>
<li>form.checkValidity()&nbsp; &nbsp;//returns false if any input is invalid</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>onChange - for a given element, as the person exits the field,&nbsp; validate the element and display a custom message.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Field Validation
<ul>
<li>Your form tag&nbsp;should have a 'novalidate' attribute so that the default submit validation will not occur.</li>
<li>All Validation will be done using Javascript for this project.&nbsp; I've stubbed out the following functions in the JS to accomplish this.&nbsp; See the 'TODO' markers in the template to know what to do<br>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #e67e23;"">validateForm()</span>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #000000;"">Runs all of the tests (already stubbed out for you)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style=""color: #e67e23;"">checkRequired(fieldId, RequiredMessage)</span>
<ul>
<li>Checks if field has a value, or checkbox group has a checked element</li>
<li>used for all required fields (first, last, address,etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style=""color: #e67e23;"">checkFormat(fieldId, BadFormatMessage, regex)</span>
<ul>
<li>Check the 'value' of an input against a regex</li>
<li>Regex expressions are found at top of validation.js</li>
<li>for the 'phoneRegex'-go to regexer.com or reg101.com and find a suitable phone number regex and use that</li>
<li>See this <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""https://replit.com/@kjenson/regex-test-method#index.js"" target=""_blank"">regex text repl</a> for examples</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style=""color: #e67e23;"">validateState(fieldId, InvalidMessage)</span>
<ul>
<li>check if the value of the field is in the 'stateAbbreviations' array at the top of validation.js in the template.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style=""color: #e67e23;"">setElementValidity(id, valid, message)</span>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #000000;"">Uses setCustomValidity to set the ':valid' and ':invalid' properties on an input.</span>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #000000;"">These properties can be used in CSS to show red or green borders, error messages etc.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style=""color: #000000;"">inserts message in the error div just below the input</span>
<ul>
<li>
<pre><span style=""color: #000000;"">&lt;li &gt;<br>  &nbsp;&lt;label for=""email""&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;<br>  &nbsp;&lt;input type=""text"" id=""email"" name=""email"" <span style=""color: #e67e23;"">class='was-validated'</span> placeholder=""Enter your email here""&gt;<br>  &nbsp;<span style=""color: #e67e23;"">&lt;div class=""errorMsg""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span><br>&lt;/li&gt;</span></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using CSS rules, you can style inputs based on the pseudo classes as follows
<ul>
<li>Remember you must add the 'was-validated' class to an input for the errors to show (see above, this class is added using javascript):
<ul>
<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ul>
<li>
<pre><span style=""color: #e03e2d;"">/*only show error information when 'was-validated' class is added to the input*/</span><br>input.was-validated:invalid {<br>&nbsp; color: red;<br>&nbsp; border: 1px solid red;<br>}<br><br>input.was-validated:invalid ~ div {<br>&nbsp; display: block;<br>}<br><span style=""color: #e03e2d;"">/* hide all error divs <br>~ is the general sibling selector and selects 'div' siblings of the input*/</span><br>input:valid ~ div {<br>&nbsp; display: none;<br>}<br><br>input:invalid ~ div {<br>&nbsp; display: none;<br>}</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>General Rules</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fields should be validated 'onChange' (tab out or exit of input after field has changed).&nbsp;</li>
<li>An error message should be displayed below the input if input has error.</li>
<li>If field is Valid we should indicate with red or green colored border</li>
<li><span>When submit button is clicked,&nbsp; validation is performed on the whole form.</span>
<ul>
<li><span>If form is valid, hide the form and display a thank you message.</span></li>
<li><span>If form is invalid,</span><br>
<ul>
<li><span>mark the fields as invalid (css), and show the error message below the field. (just like you do onChange)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Overall&nbsp;Considerations</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Responsiveness (Desktop/Tablet)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Your grid/flexbox layout and css should make your profile and new form look nice on both a large desktop as well as a tablet size</li>
<li><span style=""color: #e67e23;"">Extra Credit:&nbsp; make your form mobile responsive (+3)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Styling</strong>
<ul>
<li>You should utilize your CSS skills to make your form LOOK NICE!&nbsp; &nbsp;Use colors, gradients, background images, drop shadows,&nbsp; images, icons etc. to enhance the look and feel of your form.</li>
<li>You should modify your 'Theme' from Project 4 to apply theme to your form</li>

(4 points)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C.&nbsp;Suppose that a TCP message containing 2048 bytes of application data and a 20 byte TCP header is passed down to IP for delivery across two networks (from the source host to a router to the destination host). &nbsp;The message, as it is passed down from TCP to IP, would look like this:</p>
<p><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/552639/files/114432256/preview?verifier=zQVbooFxJjj0oPViBre49fA7sBVWgvGtO2yiBt83"" alt=""TCPIP.PNG"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/552639/files/114432256"" data-api-returntype=""File""></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Original TCP Message)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first network crossed has an MTU (frame payload maximum) of 4096 bytes; the second network has a 1024 byte MTU. &nbsp;Each network’s MTU determines the maximum sized IP packet that can be transmitted, including the IP header (but not including the frame header). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Give the sizes and offsets for the sequence of IP packet fragments delivered up to the IP layer at the destination host. &nbsp;Give the offset as an actual byte count (not the mod 8 value). &nbsp;Assume that all IP headers are 20 bytes, and be careful when calculating the offset value (the Offset field in the IP header). &nbsp;You may find it helpful to draw a picture of each fragment to visualize it. &nbsp;You may also wish to refer to the Lecture 2 slide titled “Rules for Sizing Fragments”. &nbsp;(6 points)</p>

<ol>
<li>Using the tree method.&nbsp; Show the tree at the end of each step.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Using the table method.&nbsp; Create a table that shows (for each node):
<ol>
<li>The total distance from node D</li>
<li>The next node (via)</li>

</ol>
<p>The main difference between the methods</p>
<ul>
<li>the first method shows all possible known nodes as dashed-possibilities and picks the shortest one (making the selection a solid line)</li>
<li>the second method always picks the next node by selecting the next destination node with the next shortest total distance from the source node to next destination node, but ignores nodes that aren't the next shortest total distance</li>
</ul>
<p>Like we discussed at the end of class, if two nodes have the same next shortest total distance from source node, just pick one.&nbsp; Both methods will generate the same optimal outcome (shortest total distances from a source node to all other nodes) regardless of which of the equal total distance nodes that you pick next.</p>
<ol start=""48"">

Create a routing database (table) similar to Table 3.14 on page 258. (You may find it more useful to number the steps as listed in the algorithm on page 257.) Illustrate the progression of the algorithm using Radia Perlman’s technique as illustrated on slides 7-8 through 7-14.&nbsp; Draw one tree for each pass through the algorithm.&nbsp; After each iteration, also create the resulting routing table (similar to the routing table on slide 7-14).&nbsp; The tree for the first pass is shown below.&nbsp; The tables and trees may be drawn by hand and scanned or photographed for submission to Canvas.&nbsp; (10 points)</li>

<p>Start by reading Chapters 1 and 2 of this book by Rosenbaum:</p>
<p><a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""NaturalExperimentsAndRandomizationInference-1.pdf"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/580440/files/119896716?verifier=NldCelDbAY7LZyXJDcZcSrLHjzyD8ZlnoDUGZTuM&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/580440/files/119896716"" data-api-returntype=""File"">NaturalExperimentsAndRandomizationInference-1.pdf</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your homework you may do any one of the following:</p>
<p>1. Find a natural experiment of your own and write about it. You may describe what you read somewhere in the media, but if you do try to track down the original scientific article(s) that any media reports are based on. Submit a one page report.</p>
<p>2. Simulate randomization inference within R. You may use the examples provided by Rosenbaum in Chapter 2. Try to connect this with AB testing if you can.</p>
<p>3. Study this paper, written by your instructor and others, <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05692"" target=""_blank"">https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05692</a> . Comment on whether you think randomization inference can be generalized to the observational study setting or not. Submit a one page summary of what you learned.</p>

The specific device we will study carefully is that of a second control group. The broader context is that of covariate selection.</p>
<p>Start by carefully reading this paper: <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""SamSecondControlGroups.pdf"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/580440/files/119896722?verifier=IvZFQV3y3SzqDGPZR3e2IPcfPwPvQFEK9twPfeEQ&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/580440/files/119896722"" data-api-returntype=""File"">SamSecondControlGroups.pdf</a> .</p>
<p>To complete this assignment you may do any one of the following options.</p>
<p>1. Conduct simulations by making data generating processes to see if it is or is not reasonable to be cautious about adjusting for some types of pre-treatment covariates. You may include M bias in your analysis if you'd like. See <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0324"" target=""_blank"">https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0324</a> .</p>
<p>2. Write a report about ""matching"" in statistics. You can find some relevant reading in Part 2 of that book by Rosenbaum:</p>
<p><a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""Matching.pdf"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/580440/files/119896717?verifier=6pmSkKG78raGw6llplrpEnOmf4Kh8FL3kP6Yj8s8&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/580440/files/119896717"" data-api-returntype=""File"">Matching.pdf</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Do some research and describe an additional quasi-experimental device (besides second control groups) that you find compelling. A one page report should suffice.</p>

Perhaps a good place to start is the following paper by Ding and VanderWeele. Here is a link:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4820664/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4820664/</a> .</p>
<p>However, this assignment is more about bridging gaps between causal graphs and the causal inferential frameworks of Rubin and Rosenbaum. Note that Rosenbaum's framework for sensitivity analysis can be found in Section 3.4 of his book. See <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""RoseBook.pdf"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/580440/files/119896718?verifier=4N78LUfABzBsKQrP82LDeeQ3Z66LeXr02PchVUgD&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/580440/files/119896718"" data-api-returntype=""File"">RoseBook.pdf</a> .&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following may greatly interest you. It is a paper by VanderWeele that combines the covariate selection issue with causal graphs. Here is a link: <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166439/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166439/</a> .</p>
<p>Finally, we arrive at the main topic of study this week; incorporation of time into the analysis. Here is a paper from the 1980s that introduced some important ideas. <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""RobinsOriginalPaper.pdf"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/580440/files/119896719?verifier=i7g1EdcTUX6hVpSuVh43PBMYYJbXRCHLHz3yrcoh&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/580440/files/119896719"" data-api-returntype=""File"">RobinsOriginalPaper.pdf</a> . Note that Robins was VanderWeele's PhD advisor at Harvard.</p>
<p>This is a challenging week with much to study, so make sure you attend class, ask questions, and plan head. You are being asked to write a one page report about how time information can be incorporated into analyses for causal inference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. As with Dagitty (see <a href=""http://www.dagitty.net/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.dagitty.net</a> ) you are being asked to implement the back door criterion of Pearl (see <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""PearlOverview-3.pdf"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/580440/files/119896720?verifier=9toPIPW8VdlGCKu1xBpi14qB6vch99bo8dCNqkOd&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/580440/files/119896720"" data-api-returntype=""File"">PearlOverview-3.pdf</a> ). You must on your computer construct an algorithm that takes a causal graph (a directed, acyclic graph, implemented as say an adjacency matrix), with labels for the treatment/exposure and the outcome/response along with covariates, and then the algorithm will output a list of minimal sufficient sets of covariates for unbiased adjustment. See the minimum sufficient adjustment sets in Dagitty (found in the upper right corner) for concrete insight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Conduct statistical simulations to assess the seriousness of this M bias concern. Ding and Miratrix have this paper <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0324"" target=""_blank"">https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0324</a> . Pearl responded with this comment: <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""PearlComment.pdf"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/580440/files/119896721?verifier=2NfjPmACbAMIEY9yJaLXNPdACHbSehf5RJT3MreG&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/580440/files/119896721"" data-api-returntype=""File"">PearlComment.pdf</a> . Who is right, and why? Conduct simulations to find out.</p>
<p>3. (Difficult) Theoretically develop principles to guide selection of interventions on a causal graph using the graph, details contained within the data, and other details (e.g. random assignment of a variable or low cost of an intervention) as required.</p>
<p>For credit you must present evidence to your instructor that you completed one of the three tasks described above sometime before the due date.</p>

536258,5934454,Large Program,"<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118710790/canvas_global_app.css""><p>One of the things an assembler has to do is take assembly language instructions (like ADD, AND, and JMP) and convert those into binary opcodes. Each assembly instruction has a corresponding 4-bit binary opcode. For example, the binary opcode for ADD is 0001, for AND it's 0101, and for JMP it's 1100.</p>
<p>Write an LC-3 assembly language program that does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Output a message to the screen that prompts the user to type in an LC-3 assembly language instruction (like ADD). The user ends their input by pressing Enter/Return.</li>
<li>If the instruction typed by the user is a legal LC-3 assembly language instruction, your program displays the corresponding 4-bit opcode. For example, if the user types ""ADD"", the program would print out ""0001"".</li>
<li>If the instruction typed by the user is not a legal LC-3 assembly language instruction (for example,&nbsp; ""ADDD""), your program displays an appropriate error message.</li>
<li>After displaying the output, your program loops back to the top, reinitializes anything that needs to be reinitialized, and goes again.</li>
<li>Your program will exit when the user types the string ""QUIT"" and presses Enter/Return.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Your program must treat input as case insensitive, meaning that the user can type their input in any combination of upper and lower case. For example, ""ADD"", ""add"",&nbsp; and ""AdD"" would all be legal instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: As the user types an instruction, your program should echo each typed character to the monitor so they can see what they're typing.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can process characters as the user enters them or you can store them away and process them after the user hits the Return or Enter key. If you process characters as they are entered, you still have to wait until after the user hits Return/Enter before you give an error response, even if you already know it's not a valid instruction.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The algorithm you use for processing the text has to use a state machine. If the user types an 'A', you move to the A State. In the A State you check to see if the next character is either 'N' or 'D'. Anything else would be an error. If the next characer is an 'N' you move to the AN State. In the AN State you check the next character. If it's a 'D' you move to the AND State, otherwise it's an error. In the AND State, the next character has to be the CR or LF character, otherwise it's an error. Etc., etc. Rinse and repeat for all valid instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: For the BR instruction, you only need to handle ""BR"", not the&nbsp; variants&nbsp; (""BRn"", ""BRz"", ""BRp"", ""BRnz"", ""BRzp"", ""BRnp"", ""BRnzp"").</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Write your program in a text editor (not a word processor!) and save the file as you go.&nbsp; Every time you need to assemble and load the file into the Simulator you can just drag the file onto the assembler. The reason you shouldn't use a word processor (like Word) is that word processors put a bunch of non-ASCII junk into a document file. Plus they do things like smart quotes, which look like regular quotes but have a different underlying value, so the assembler doesn't interpret it correctly.</p>
<p>Submit your code as a .asm file (a .asm file is just a text file with the extension "".asm"").</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,100.0,['online_upload']

<p>For this assignment, you will explore the internal operations of the xv6 operating system and record your findings in Canvas. You will create the source code for a new userspace program named <code>assn1</code> and add it to the xv6 build system. You will use the debugger to see the kernel source code in operation. You will also examine variables in a running system. Changes you make to files will be added, committed, and pushed via git to your upstream repository for grading.</p>
<h4>Notes on the Assignment Specifications</h4>
<p>This is a long assignment and reads a lot like a tutorial. You should expect to do a lot of reading. If something has gone wrong and your results do not match the assignment, go back and try again. You will occasionally encounter call-outs like this:</p>

<h3>Part A: Setup of Docker</h3>
<p>For all assignments this semester you will be using the xv6 docker container that I have created. You can <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""https://hub.docker.com/r/jjolly/xv6"" target=""_blank"">find the container in Docker Hub</a> and the <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""https://github.com/jjolly/xv6-docker"" target=""_blank"">Dockerfile used to create the image in GitHub</a>. In order to use this container you need a working installation of Docker. This task will depend on the system you are running on:</p>
<h4>Linux</h4>
<p>Nearly all Linux distributions have a package for Docker. For Ubuntu this package name is <code>docker.io</code>. Fedora has instruction for installing the <code>docker-ce</code> package. Installing on openSUSE can be done via YaST or installing the <code>docker</code> package. Other distributions have instructions that can be found via a Google search. Ultimately you should be able to perform the following from the command line:</p>
<pre>$ docker version<br><br>Client: Docker Engine - Community<br>&nbsp;Cloud integration: v1.0.22<br>&nbsp;Version: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20.10.11<br><br>...<br><br>Server: Docker Engine - Community<br>&nbsp;Engine:<br>&nbsp; Version: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20.10.11<br>&nbsp; API version: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.41 (minimum version 1.12)<br><br>...</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>$ docker run --rm hello-world<br><br>...<br><br>Hello from Docker!<br>This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.<br><br>...</pre>
<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>I would recommend installing Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 along with Docker Desktop. You can find help in the installation video found in the <a title=""M1 - Watch: Tools for the Class"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/570909/pages/m1-watch-tools-for-the-class"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/570909/pages/m1-watch-tools-for-the-class"" data-api-returntype=""Page"">module videos page</a>.</p>
<p>You can also install a virtual machine manager such as <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""https://www.virtualbox.org/"" target=""_blank"">Oracle VirtualBox</a> or <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html"" target=""_blank"">VMWare Workstation</a>. This will allow you to install a distribution of Linux. You may then follow any of the Linux installation instructions as mentioned above. Details can also be found in the <a title=""M1 - Watch: Tools for the Class"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/570909/pages/m1-watch-tools-for-the-class"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/570909/pages/m1-watch-tools-for-the-class"" data-api-returntype=""Page"">module videos page</a>.</p>
<h4>MacOS</h4>
<p>You may install the official Docker Desktop and run docker commands from the terminal.</p>
<h3>Running xv6 in Docker</h3>
<p>Once you have determined that Docker runs for you, starting the xv6 Docker container on Linux should be a one-command task.</p>
<pre>$ docker run --tty --interactive --name xv6 --hostname xv6 --volume $HOME:$HOME jjolly/xv6</pre>
<p>The options for this command are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--tty</code>: You wish to see the console output of Docker. You can shorten this to <code>-t</code></li>
<li><code>--interactive</code>: You wish to interact (provide input) to the Docker console. You can shorten this to <code>-i</code></li>
<li><code>--name xv6</code>: Instead of some randomly-generated name, you may wish your container to have a specific name, such as xv6</li>
<li><code>--hostname xv6</code>: You may wish to assign the internal hostname of the container to xv6</li>
<li><code>--volume $HOME:$HOME</code>: This maps your home directory to an equivalent directory in your container. If your user ID is ""student"" you will find files shared on both the host and in the container in the directory <code>/home/student</code>.</li>
<li><code>jjolly/xv6</code>: The Docker image you wish to start running. You can <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""https://hub.docker.com/r/jjolly/xv6"" target=""_blank"">find the image on Docker Hub</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Windows you may start the Docker container from Powershell with the following command. Note the change in the <code>--volume</code> option:</p>
<pre>$ docker run --tty --interactive --name xv6 --hostname xv6 --volume ${HOME}:/home/userid jjolly/xv6</pre>
<p>This command will start a Bash shell inside of the TMux screen manager within the container. You are now ready to experience the xv6 OS. To see it run, type this command:</p>
<pre>$ make qemu</pre>
<p>This will build the OS kernel and userspace programs from source. It will then create a disk image with all the necessary binaries. It will then boot this disk image using the qemu emulator. After several lines of compiler output you should see the xv6 kernel boot like this:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">xv6 kernel is booting

hart 1 starting
hart 2 starting
init: starting sh
$ </pre>
<p>The xv6 operating system is now running using the qemu emulator.</p>
<table style=""border-collapse: collapse; width: 75%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" border=""5"">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style=""width: 99.9091%; text-align: center;""><strong>You are now running the xv6 command line running in the qemu emulator, and not the Linux command line. Do not expect all Linux commands to work until you have stopped the qemu emulator.</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You can now see the names of several xv6 commands if you type <code>ls</code> (list files):</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">$ ls

zombie         2 18 22176

<p>Except for the directory files <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>, as well as the device file <code>console</code>, these are all userspace program you can run. We will look at many of them during this semester.</p>
<p>To stop the qemu emulator, you need to use the qemu exit command <code>Ctrl-a, x</code>. This has the effect of ""turning off"" the machine that is running the xv6 operating system. When you stop the qemu emulator, you have caused the xv6 command line to stop running.</p>

<h3>Install an Editor</h3>
<p>Your xv6 OS container does not have an editor installed. This is done to keep the size of the Docker image small and reduce download times. Before installing anything into the xv6 container, always run <code>apt update</code> first. Here are three common editors you can install:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nano: A fairly simple editor that is friendly to people new to console editors. It is fairly small - less than 1MB installed. It can be installed with:
<ul>
<li><code>apt install nano</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vim: A much more feature-rich editor, but the user interface is extremely minimalistic. This can be very confusing to newcomers and should be used cautiously. This is the editor your instructor uses because of the minimalism. It's a little larger installed at 37MB. It can be installed with:
<ul>
<li><code>apt install vim</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emacs: An entire environment of functionality that has been described as, ""A good operating system with a passible editor."" It even has the Lisp programming language built-in. A basic console installation<sup>*</sup> takes 148MB. It can be installed with:
<ul>
<li><code>apt install emacs-nox</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The typical Emacs installation includes the x11 GUI and quickly approaches 350MB. You are welcome to install whatever you want, but you likely won't use the GUI component in this Docker container.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Part B: Creating a userspace Program for xv6</h3>
<p>The xv6 operating system source code is divided up into two main categories: The kernel code and the userspace code. Userspace programs are used to interact with the kernel and perform useful functions. The <code>ls</code> command used in the earlier demonstration is an example of a userspace program. The source code for the <code>ls</code> program can be found in <code>user/ls.c</code>.</p>
<p>In order for the xv6 build system to recognize the userspace source code, each userspace program must be added to the <code>Makefile</code>. A variable in the <code>Makefile</code> called <code>UPROGS</code> lists the names of all the userspace programs that will be built and included in the file system. The list looks something like this:</p>
<pre>UPROGS=\<br>&nbsp; $U/_cat\<br>&nbsp; $U/_echo\<br>&nbsp; $U/_forktest\<br>&nbsp; $U/_grep\<br>&nbsp; $U/_init\<br>&nbsp; $U/_kill\<br>&nbsp; $U/_ln\<br>&nbsp; $U/_ls\<br>&nbsp; $U/_mkdir\<br>&nbsp; $U/_rm\<br>&nbsp; $U/_sh\<br>&nbsp; $U/_stressfs\<br>&nbsp; $U/_usertests\<br>&nbsp; $U/_grind\<br>&nbsp; $U/_wc\<br>&nbsp; $U/_zombie\</pre>
<p>The name of your userspace program must match the name of the source in the user directory. For this part of the assignment you will create a userspace program named <code>assn1</code>. You will do this by creating a file named <code>assn1.c</code> in the <code>user</code> directory, then adding <code>$U/_assn1\</code> to the Makefile <code>UPROGS</code> variable.</p>
<p>The minimum source code for an xv6 userspace program is as follows:</p>
<pre>#include ""kernel/types.h""<br>#include ""user/user.h""<br><br>int<br>main(int argc, char *argv[])<br>{<br>&nbsp; exit(0);<br>}</pre>
<p>This looks like a typical C program with two major differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>You must include the two header files <code>kernel/types.h</code> and <code>user/user.h</code>
<ul>
<li>You may include other header files, but these two must always be included</li>
<li>There is no <code>stdio.h</code> in xv6. Everything you can use can be found in <code>user/user.h</code>. Open the file in an editor to become familiar with what you can work with.

<td style=""width: 99.9091%; text-align: center;""><strong>For all the assignments, you will only ever need <code>kernel/types.h</code> and <code>user/user.h</code> - Adding other includes will likely cause you compile errors and heartache.</strong></td>

</tbody>
</table>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You must call <code>exit(0)</code> at the end of your program
<ul>
<li>Traditionally when a C program terminates the <code>exit(0)</code> function is called automatically after your program calls <code>return</code>. This is not true for xv6. Every userspace program must be terminated by manually calling the <code>exit(0)</code> function.</li>
<li>This is an often-overlook source for bugs in xv6 userspace programs. It can be easy to overlook an exit point in <code>main</code> if there are multiple <code>return</code> statements.

<h3>Userspace Program Specification</h3>
<p>You userspace program must show your ability to write a working C program. Your <code>assn1</code> userspace program will calculate the nth value of the Fibonacci Sequence.</p>
<p>The Fibonacci Sequence is fairly simple to understand and implement. The first two values in the sequence are given, specifically v<sub>0</sub> = 0 and v<sub>1</sub> = 1. All other values in the sequence are calculated from the previous two based on the function v<sub>n</sub> = v<sub>n-1</sub> + v<sub>n-2</sub>. This gives us the first five values of the Fibonacci Sequence as:</p>
<ul>
<li>v<sub>0</sub> = 0</li>
<li>v<sub>1</sub> = 1</li>
<li>v<sub>2</sub> = v<sub>1</sub> + v<sub>0</sub> = 1 + 0 = 1</li>
<li>v<sub>3</sub> = v<sub>2</sub> + v<sub>1</sub> = 1 + 1 = 2</li>
<li>v<sub>4</sub> = v<sub>3</sub> + v<sub>2</sub> = 2 + 1 = 3</li>
</ul>
<p>To determine which value to calculate and print, you must read the number from the options passed on the command line. If nothing is on the command line, then return v<sub>0</sub>. Your output should appear like this:</p>
<pre>$ assn1<br>assn1: by John Jolly<br>Fibonacci number 0 is 0<br>$ assn1 4<br>assn1: by John Jolly<br>Fibonacci number 4 is 3<br>$ assn1 25<br>assn1: by John Jolly<br>Fibonacci number 25 is 75025</pre>
<p>Your program must print out the header line with the name of the program and your name. Your program must output the result formatted as shown above, with both the sequence number as well as the sequence value.</p>

</tr>

<p>Once you have created, built, and run your program you will add your changes (two files) to your repository and commit them to a git branch named assn1.</p>

<h3>Part C: Debugging the xv6 operating system</h3>
<p>A small description of the environment you will be debugging in is in order. The xv6 operating system is designed to run on the RISC-V (pronounced ""risk-five"") architecture. This is much like Intel or Arm but is considered more open in the sense of open source. All the <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/"" target=""_blank"">RISC-V architecture manuals</a> are freely available and we will reference them a few times during the course. They are not light reading but contain much valuable information.</p>
<h3>Running xv6 in the GDB debugger</h3>
<p>To debug the xv6 operating system you will need to run xv6 in one console window using the <code>make qemu-gdb</code> command and the debugger in a second console window using the <code>gdb-multiarch</code> command. In order to accommodate this two-console requirement the TMux console manager is used. TMux uses the <code>Ctrl-b</code> key to begin commands. Here is a short list of useful TMux commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Ctrl-b, c</code>: Create a new console window. Each window is sequentially numbered when it is created</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-b, #</code>: Where # is a digit 0-9. This allows you to switch directly to a specific console</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-b, p</code> and <code>Ctrl-b, n</code>: Allows you to switch from the current console to the previous or next console</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-b, d</code>: Detach from TMux and return to the starting console. This will cause Docker to terminate the container. Probably not what you want to do
<ul>
<li>If you did detach from TMux, you can restart the container by typing <code>docker start -ai xv6</code></li>
<li>To avoid this problem detach from the Docker container with the <code>Ctrl-p, Ctrl-q</code> key sequence. This detaches your console from the container tty and allows the container to run in the background.</li>
<li>You can reattach to the container by typing <code>docker attach xv6</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</table>
<p>In order to debug xv6, you need to type this command:</p>
<pre>$ make qemu-gdb</pre>
<p>This will cause xv6 to be run in qemu running as a GDB server. You will see a message such as this:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">*** Now run 'gdb' in another window.
qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt ...</pre>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You can now create a new console by typing <code>Ctrl-b, c</code>. In the new console type:</p>
<pre>$ gdb-multiarch</pre>
<p>This will start the GDB debugger for our xv6 OS. For now allow GDB to continue by typing <code>cont</code>. To switch from the debugger screen back to the xv6 OS type <code>Ctrl-b, p</code> to switch to the previous console. To switch from the xv6 OS back to the debugger screen type <code>Ctrl-b, n</code> to switch to the next console.</p>

<td style=""width: 99.9091%; text-align: center;""><strong>You now have two ""windows."" One with the qemu emulator and a second with the debugger which is controlling the emulator in the first window.</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When you exit qemu using <code>Ctrl-a, x</code> you will cause the debugger to lose it's connection. You can exit the debugger with the <code>quit</code> command.</p>
<h4>GDB Commands: Examine and Print</h4>
<p>The next GDB command is the ""examine"" command, which is just the letter <code>x</code>. You use ""examine"" when you want to see what is stored in memory at a variable or address. One of the nice things about ""examine"" is the formatting option. To format the output of ""examine"", you follow the <code>x</code> with a slash and a format specifier. There are several format specifiers you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>x</code>: Output in hexadecimal, or base 16</li>
<li><code>d</code>: Output in decimal, or base 10</li>
<li><code>t</code>: Output in binary, or base 2</li>
<li><code>f</code>: Output a IEEE-754 floating point number</li>
<li><code>c</code>: Output ASCII character, or escaped unicode character</li>
<li><code>s</code>: Output a NULL-terminated string</li>
<li><code>a</code>: Address output, including offset from nearest symbol</li>
</ul>
<p>The ""examine"" command is similar to another command, ""print"", or just the letter <code>p</code>. Commonly ""examine"" is used to view memory or registers, whereas ""print"" is used to view variables. Also, ""print"" allows for evaluating expressions. For example, the ""print"" command can do the following:</p>
<pre>(gdb) p (10 + 30 / 6) / 5<br>$1 = 3</pre>
<p>Another nice thing about the ""print"" command is that a temporary numeric variable is created to store each output. So, for this example, if you wish to reuse the result of this expression, you just need to use the variable <code>$1</code>.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>When the debugger is first started for xv6, the first instruction to be executed is actually in the system BIOS and not in the xv6 code. There's only a few instructions in the BIOS that need to run. We can look at those instructions by typing the command <code>x/5i $pc</code>:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">0x0000000000001000 in ?? ()
(gdb) x/5i $pc
=&gt; 0x1000:      auipc   t0,0x0
   0x1004:      addi    a2,t0,40
   0x1008:      csrr    a0,mhartid
   0x100c:      ld      a1,32(t0)
   0x1010:      ld      t0,24(t0)
(gdb)</pre>
<p>The first line above is output by the debugger to let us know where we are debugging in the system. I shows the current address stored in the Program Counter (PC), in this case the address is <code>0x0000000000001000</code>, or <code>0x1000</code>. The command I gave has four parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>x</code>: This is the Memory Examine command. It is frequently used to analyze memory in various formats. Those formats follow the forward-slash after the command</li>
<li><code>5</code>: This is the count of items we wish to examine. In this case, we want to examine five instructions</li>
<li><code>i</code>: This is the format of the output. We want to see the machine instructions at this address, so we use <code>i</code></li>
<li><code>$pc</code>: This is the address we wish to examine. For our purposes we want to see the instructions starting where the program counter currently references. All registers are accessed using the dollar-sign ($).</li>
</ul>
<p>We could have found the same results if we had typed the address directly, like this:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">(gdb) x/5i 0x1000
=&gt; 0x1000: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;auipc &nbsp; t0,0x0<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;0x1004: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;addi &nbsp; &nbsp;a2,t0,40<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;0x1008: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;csrr &nbsp; &nbsp;a0,mhartid<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;0x100c: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ld &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a1,32(t0)<br>  &nbsp;0x1010: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ld &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;t0,24(t0)</pre>
<p>What you are looking at are the assembly instructions that are first executed when the emulator starts. This is the human readable format of the machine instructions. You can see the actual machine instructions using the <code>x/5x $pc</code> command:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">(gdb) x/5x 0x1000<br>0x1000: 0x00000297 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0x02828613 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0xf1402573 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0x0202b583<br>0x1010: 0x0182b283</pre>
<p>Now to move onto parts of the code that are more readable. There are actually five stages to the startup of the xv6 operating system:</p>
<ol>
<li>BIOS: This is at address <code>0x1000</code> and is not actually part of the xv6 operating system. This is where your debugger will always start. You will usually move on quickly from this stage with the <code>cont</code> continue command.</li>
<li><code>_entry</code>: This is the assembly language entry point of the xv6 operating system and the source code can be found in the <code>kernel/entry.S</code> file. This part of the code sets up the kernel stack for each CPU. It is short and we will not concern ourselves with this code for this assignment.</li>
<li><code>start</code>: This is where the C source starts for xv6. The source code can be found in <code>kernel/start.c</code>. This code performs several configuration steps for the CPU in preparation for running as an operating system kernel.</li>
<li><code>main</code>: This is where the kernel initializes the data structures used internally by the xv6 operating system. The source code can be found in <code>kernel/main.c</code>. Things like the console, the storage device, main memory, and many other kernel structures will be initialized here.</li>
<li><code>scheduler</code>: This is the part of the kernel that manages processes. The source code can be found in <code>kernel/proc.c</code>. Technically the scheduler function loops forever on each CPU and never exits, always choosing another process. We will discuss this part of the kernel in depth shortly.</li>
</ol>
<h4>GDB Commands: Setting, Viewing, and Deleting Breakpoints</h4>
<p>For now you will skip over the <code>_entry</code> and the <code>start</code> parts of the operating system. Let's investigate where the operating system really starts to initialize itself. Do this by setting a breakpoint on <code>main</code>&nbsp;and continuing the debugger:</p>
<pre>(gdb) b main<br>Breakpoint 1 at 0x80000e80: file kernel/main.c, line 13.<br>(gdb) c<br>Continuing.<br>[Switching to Thread 1.2]<br><br>Thread 2 hit Breakpoint 1, main () at kernel/main.c:13<br>13 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if(cpuid() == 0){<br>(gdb)</pre>
<p>You have hit the breakpoint and are now at the top of the <code>main</code> function of the kernel. Breakpoints allow the debugger to execute until a specific point in the code has been reached. We can allow the operating system to initialize and stop just as the first process is about to be scheduled by setting a function breakpoint on the function named <code>scheduler</code>:</p>
<pre>(gdb) b scheduler<br>Breakpoint 2 at 0x80001ea2: file kernel/proc.c, line 446.<br>(gdb) c<br>Continuing.<br>[Switching to Thread 1.1]<br><br>Thread 1 hit Breakpoint 1, main () at kernel/main.c:13<br>13 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if(cpuid() == 0){<br>(gdb)</pre>
<p>What's this? Wasn't the debugger suppose to halt at the next breakpoint? The debugger has stopped at the breakpoint for <code>main</code> again. This is because the xv6 operating system defaults to being emulated on a 3 CPU system, and the debugger has hit a breakpoint on another CPU. For now, we don't need the breakpoint on <code>main</code>, so let's delete the breakpoint.</p>
<pre>(gdb) info breakpoints&nbsp;<br>Num &nbsp; &nbsp; Type &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Disp Enb Address &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What<br>1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; breakpoint &nbsp; &nbsp; keep y &nbsp; 0x0000000080000e80 in main at kernel/main.c:13<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; breakpoint already hit 2 times<br>2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; breakpoint &nbsp; &nbsp; keep y &nbsp; 0x0000000080001ea2 in scheduler at kernel/proc.c:446<br>(gdb) d 1<br>(gdb) info breakpoints&nbsp;<br>Num &nbsp; &nbsp; Type &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Disp Enb Address &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What<br>2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; breakpoint &nbsp; &nbsp; keep y &nbsp; 0x0000000080001ea2 in scheduler at kernel/proc.c:446<br>(gdb)</pre>
<p>The first <code>info breakpoints</code> command shows two breakpoints are set. Breakpoint #1 is set for the <code>main</code> function in <code>kernel/main.c</code> at line 13. Breakpoint #2 is set for the <code>scheduler</code> function in <code>kernel/proc.c</code> at line 446. Since the first breakpoint is not needed, the ""delete"" command, or <code>d</code> - along with the breakpoint number 1 - removes the breakpoint. This is shown by listing the breakpoints with the <code>info breakpoints</code> command. Note that the breakpoint number did not change for our <code>scheduler</code> breakpoint - it is still breakpoint #2. All breakpoints that are set will have a unique numeric identifier.</p>

</table>
<p>Now we can allow the system to continue until one of the CPUs reach the <code>scheduler</code> breakpoint. Listing the code will show the first lines of the <code>scheduler</code> function.</p>
<pre>(gdb) c<br>Continuing.<br><br>Thread 1 hit Breakpoint 2, scheduler () at kernel/proc.c:446<br>446 &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>(gdb) l<br>441 &nbsp; &nbsp; // &nbsp;- swtch to start running that process.<br>442 &nbsp; &nbsp; // &nbsp;- eventually that process transfers control<br>443 &nbsp; &nbsp; // &nbsp; &nbsp;via swtch back to the scheduler.<br>444 &nbsp; &nbsp; void<br>445 &nbsp; &nbsp; scheduler(void)<br>446 &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>447 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; struct proc *p;<br>448 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; struct cpu *c = mycpu();<br>449 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>450 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c-&gt;proc = 0;<br>(gdb)</pre>
<h4>GDB Commands: Stepping Over and Into Function Calls</h4>
<p>In order to use the debugger to step from one line to the next within the debugger, the ""next"" command, or <code>n</code> should be used. Try to step over the next several lines:</p>
<pre>(gdb) n<br>448 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; struct cpu *c = mycpu();<br>(gdb) n<br>450 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c-&gt;proc = 0;<br>(gdb) n<br>453 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; intr_on();<br>(gdb) n<br>[Switching to Thread 1.2]<br><br>Thread 2 hit Breakpoint 2, scheduler () at kernel/proc.c:446<br>446 &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>(gdb)</pre>
<p>Suddenly in this example the debugger switch from line 453 in thread number 1 to our breakpoint at line 446 for thread number 2. This can happen in multithreaded programs such as our emulated multi-cpu system. It may take you a few times stepping through the code with the ""next"" command, but you will experience this eventually. This (very annoying) thread switching can be limited by changing the <code>scheduler-locking</code> setting in the debugger There are several values that can be used, we'll start with <code>step</code> which prevents thread switching so long as we are stepping line-by-line:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">(gdb) set scheduler-locking step</pre>

<td style=""width: 99.9091%; text-align: center;""><strong>The default configuration for xv6 emulates three CPUs. Debugging commands may switch between the three CPUs unexpectedly unless you use the set scheduler-locking step command.</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now the debugger should allow us to single-step through the code and not randomly switch to another thread when we least expect it. Step through the lines of code until it stops at line 456 (once you type a command, the enter key alone will repeat that command). Type the ""next"" command followed by the enter key alone four times:</p>
<pre>(gdb) set scheduler-locking step<br>(gdb) n<br>448 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; struct cpu *c = mycpu();<br>(gdb)&nbsp;<br>450 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c-&gt;proc = 0;<br>(gdb)&nbsp;<br>453 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; intr_on();<br>(gdb)&nbsp;<br>455 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for(p = proc; p &lt; &amp;proc[NPROC]; p++) {<br>(gdb)&nbsp;<br>456 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; acquire(&amp;p-&gt;lock);<br>(gdb)</pre>
<h4>Examining In-memory Structures</h4>
<p>An important skill when debugging is to view the contents of data structures while debugging. Notice that on line 455 above the <code>for</code> loop is initializing the <code>p</code> variable with the value of the <code>proc</code> variable. This is actually a memory address pointer that really has no direct meaning to the debugger:</p>
<pre>(gdb) p p<br>$2 = (struct proc *) 0x80010f80 &lt;proc&gt;<br>(gdb)&nbsp;</pre>
<p>The debugger tells us several things about the pointer: the type of the pointer is <code>struct proc *</code>, the memory address, and the closest symbol to the address (in this case, the variable named <code>proc</code>). But the actual content of the structure is not shown. To do that, the pointer needs to be dereferenced:</p>
<pre>(gdb) p *p<br>$3 = {lock = {locked = 1, name = 0x800081f8 ""proc"", cpu = 0x80010b80 &lt;cpus&gt;}, state = RUNNABLE, chan = 0x0, killed = 0, xstate = 0, pid = 1, parent = 0x0, kstack = 274877894656, sz = 4096, pagetable = 0x87f73000, trapframe = 0x87f74000, context = {ra = 2147490276, sp = 274877898752, s0 = 0, s1 = 0, s2 = 0, s3 = 0, s4 = 0, s5 = 0, s6 = 0, s7 = 0, s8 = 0, s9 = 0, s10 = 0, s11 = 0}, ofile = { 0x0 &lt;repeats 16 times&gt;}, cwd = 0x8001f090 &lt;itable+24&gt;, name = ""initcode\000\000\000\000\000\000\000""}<br>(gdb)</pre>
<p>Using the dereference operator (the asterisk) we are allowed to view the data within the structure. Unfortunately this is very difficult to read. By changing another GDB setting, we can allow GDB to cleanly format the output of the structure. The following command will make the setting change for you:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">(gdb) set print pretty on</pre>
<p>Now try and print the dereferenced <code>p</code> variable again:</p>
<pre>(gdb) p *p<br>$4 = {<br>&nbsp; lock = {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; locked = 1,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; name = 0x800081f8 ""proc"",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; cpu = 0x80010b80 &lt;cpus&gt;<br>&nbsp; },<br>&nbsp; state = RUNNABLE,<br>&nbsp; chan = 0x0,<br>&nbsp; killed = 0,<br>&nbsp; xstate = 0,<br>&nbsp; pid = 1,<br>&nbsp; parent = 0x0,<br>&nbsp; kstack = 274877894656,<br>&nbsp; sz = 4096,<br>&nbsp; pagetable = 0x87f73000,<br>&nbsp; trapframe = 0x87f74000,<br>&nbsp; context = {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; ra = 2147490276,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; sp = 274877898752,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; s0 = 0,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; s1 = 0,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; s2 = 0,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; s3 = 0,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; s4 = 0,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; s5 = 0,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; s6 = 0,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; s7 = 0,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; s8 = 0,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; s9 = 0,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; s10 = 0,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; s11 = 0<br>&nbsp; },<br>&nbsp; ofile = {0x0 &lt;repeats 16 times&gt;},<br>&nbsp; cwd = 0x8001f090 &lt;itable+24&gt;,<br>&nbsp; name = ""initcode\000\000\000\000\000\000\000""<br>}</pre>
<p>This is the process structure for the <code>initcode</code> process. Some important members to this structure are:</p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: disc;"">
<li><code>state</code>: This is the current state of the process. Right now the process is in the state <code>RUNNABLE</code>. There are other states that a process can be in, which we will discuss in the next few weeks</li>
<li><code>pid</code>: This is a unique numerical identifier for the process. Every process has a unique process ID.</li>
<li><code>parent</code>: This is a pointer to the process structure of the parent process. More will be discussed regarding the process parent/child relationship</li>
<li><code>sz</code>: This is the number of bytes of memory used by the process</li>
<li><code>pagetable</code>: A structure that defines how memory is organized for the process. Much will be said about page tables later in the semester</li>
<li><code>context</code>: These are the registers that were set for the process when the process was paused. Since we're running in the operating system kernel, the registers of the process need to be stored here until the kernel has finished running and switches back to the process.</li>
<li><code>ofile</code>: The open file table. This will be discussed in a later part of the class</li>
<li><code>name</code>: The character string name of the process. Usually the name of the program that was executed.</li>

<p>Let's practice debugging the kernel after starting a program. Delete the scheduler breakpoint and continue the operating system (you should know how to do this now). This will allow the xv6 operating system to come up fully. You can now switch away from the gdb window to the xv6 window using the TMux <code>Ctrl-b, p</code> command.</p>
<p>For this assignment, you will answer questions about a process when a system call is made. Specifically, you will set a breakpoint that will halt the debugger in the <code>fork()</code> system call. To set this breakpoint, switch to the console with the debugger. Because the xv6 operating system is running, you initially will not see the debugger prompt. To halt xv6 and get to a debugger prompt, you need to interrupt the debugger using the <code>Ctrl-c</code> command. You should see the following when you press <code>Ctrl-c</code>:</p>
<pre>^C<br>Thread 2 received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.<br>acquire (lk=lk@entry=0x80016278 &lt;proc+21240&gt;) at kernel/spinlock.c:25<br>25 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if(holding(lk))<br>(gdb)</pre>
<p>Where the debugger stops when interrupted with <code>Ctrl-c</code> will vary, but you will be presented the gdb prompt. Note that xv6 will no longer interact with you as it is halted waiting for the debugger to resume.</p>
<table style=""border-collapse: collapse; width: 75%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" border=""5"">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>At the debugger prompt, set a breakpoint for the <code>fork()</code> function (should show as a breakpoint on line 281 in <code>kernel/proc.c</code>) and continue. Now switch back to xv6 - you'll find it's responsive again. Type the command <code>ls</code> and enter. No directory listing will be shown immediately if you set the breakpoint correctly. This is expected. Switch back to the debugger screen and you should see:</p>
<pre>[Switching to Thread 1.1]<br><br>Thread 1 hit Breakpoint 3, fork () at kernel/proc.c:281<br>281 &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>(gdb)</pre>
<p>We can see several things. We are looking at the code being executed on the first CPU (in RISC-V parlance, it's called a Hart, but we'll continue to use the generic term CPU). This is known because the debugger informed us that it has switched to thread 1.1, or the first thread which represent the first CPU. You may get a different thread, and this is fine. You also will see that the debugger has halted at line 281 in <code>kernel/proc.c</code>, precisely where we need it to be halted.</p>
<p>List the source code at this point and see what the first few lines of fork looks like:</p>
<pre>(gdb) l<br>276<br>277 &nbsp; &nbsp; // Create a new process, copying the parent.<br>278 &nbsp; &nbsp; // Sets up child kernel stack to return as if from fork() system call.<br>279 &nbsp; &nbsp; int<br>280 &nbsp; &nbsp; fork(void)<br>281 &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>282 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; int i, pid;<br>283 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; struct proc *np;<br>284 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; struct proc *p = myproc();<br>285<br>(gdb)</pre>
<p>Notice on line 284 the <code>myproc()</code> function is called and the return value is assigned to the <code>struct proc *</code> variable <code>p</code>.</p>
<p>In order to execute line 284 the ""next"" command needs to be used, but there's a problem that you can't see yet. Remember that this is a multiple CPU system, and each CPU is running as a thread in the qemu emulator - except when we step through the program. Take a look at the <code>scheduler-locking</code> setting:</p>
<pre>(gdb) show scheduler-locking&nbsp;<br>Mode for locking scheduler during execution is ""step"".<br>(gdb)</pre>
<p>This setting prevents all other threads from executing when using the ""next"" or ""step"" commands. In most cases this is not a problem, but in order to see the process structure, the <code>myproc()</code> function call needs to be made. There is something important to understand about the <code>myproc()</code> function, so let's debug into that function. Use the ""next"" command one time to advance the debugger to line 284, then use the ""step"" command to step into the <code>myproc()</code> function:</p>
<pre>(gdb) n<br>284 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; struct proc *p = myproc();<br>(gdb) s<br>myproc () at kernel/proc.c:85<br>85 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;push_off();<br>(gdb)</pre>
<p>Take a look at the source code for the <code>myproc()</code> function by using the ""list"" command:</p>
<pre>(gdb) l<br>80<br>81 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// Return the current struct proc *, or zero if none.<br>82 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;struct proc*<br>83 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;myproc(void)<br>84 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br>85 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;push_off();<br>86 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;struct cpu *c = mycpu();<br>87 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;struct proc *p = c-&gt;proc;<br>88 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pop_off();<br>89 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return p;<br>(gdb)</pre>
<p>The <code>push_off()</code> and <code>pop_off()</code> functions are important here. Those function are responsible for locking out other CPUs while this CPU does it's work. The problem is the <code>push_off()</code> function will block, or not return, if another CPU has also called <code>push_off()</code>, and will not return until the other CPU has called <code>pop_off()</code>. The detail of this will be covered when we discuss Concurency in a few weeks. If this function blocks waiting for another thread, but the <code>scheduler-locking</code> setting prevents threads from running, then the debugger will appear to lock up.</p>
<p>For now, disable the <code>scheduler-locking</code>. We do not expect that any other CPUs will be calling the <code>fork()</code> system call while we're debugging, so we don't need to worry about unexpectedly changing to another thread. Advance the debugger past line 87 (where <code>struct proc *p</code> is being set):</p>
<pre>(gdb) set scheduler-locking off<br>(gdb) n<br>86 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;struct cpu *c = mycpu();<br>(gdb) n<br>87 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;struct proc *p = c-&gt;proc;<br>(gdb) n<br>88 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pop_off();<br>(gdb)</pre>
<p>After this line has been executed, you should be able to inspect the process structure for the process that made the system call to <code>fork()</code>. Please answer the following questions about the process:</p>
<p><strong>Q1: What is the debugger command you used to display the content of the process structure?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q2: What is the process state? (hint: It should be all in upper case)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q3: What is the process ID?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q4: What is the process size?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q5: What is the process name?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q6: How many open files does this process have (hint: the number of elements in the array ofile that are not zero)</strong></p>
<p>You can also display the process structure for the parent process. Using the ""print"" command, display the structure of <code>p-&gt;parent</code> and answer the following questions:</p>
<p><strong>Q7: What is the parent process state?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q8: What is the parent process id?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q9: What is the parent process name? (hint: don't worry about anything starting at ""\000"" and after. It's usually garbage anyway)</strong></p>
<p>You should type the answers to these questions as your submission to Canvas.</p>

<p>In this assignment you will add a new system call to the xv6 operating system and write a user-mode test program. This new system call will retrieve the process id of the parent of the current process. The test program will verify that the parent process ID retrieved for a process matches the actual parent process id.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>By the end of this assignment you will demonstrate:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to create a userspace test harness program</li>
<li>How to create a new system call in xv6</li>
<li>How to properly lock internal kernel data structures</li>
<li>How to navigate the process structure in xv6</li>
<li>How to use git to add a remote repository and fetch a branch from the remote</li>
<li>How to use git to create a tar archive and submit that file to Canvas</li>
</ul>
<h3>Before You Start</h3>
<p>You will need to create a new <code>assn2</code> Git branch for your assignment. Before you can do that, you need to verify that everything is clean in your current branch. Check the status of your current branch with:</p>
<pre>$ git status<br>On branch assn1<br>Your branch is up to date with 'origin/riscv'.</pre>
<p>If anything has been changed or uncommitted please stage and commit them now. If you do not want to keep the changes, then restore those files using the instructions provided by the output of <code>git status</code>. You do not need to worry about untracked files as they should not conflict with your new branch.</p>
<p>Now make sure you have created a new Git branch for your project. You can do this the step-by-step method of:</p>
<pre>$ git checkout riscv<br>Switched to branch 'riscv'<br>$ git branch assn2<br>$ git checkout assn2<br>Switched to branch 'assn2'</pre>
<p>Or do the same thing in one step (don't try both as you will get errors about the new branch already existing):</p>
<pre>$ git checkout -b assn2 origin/riscv</pre>
<p>Now that you have a new branch, you can start editing your code.</p>
<h2>Creating the Test Program (Test Harness)</h2>
<p>You are responsible for creating a user space program that tests your new system call. In fact, you should create it first and make sure it fails where you expect it to fail. Creating the test before creating the feature is call Test Driven Development. It will help you with a target that will build and run successfully when you have completed the new feature.</p>
<p>For this assignment, you will create a test program that will call your <code>getppid</code> system call. In order for this test to work, we need to know two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The process ID of the parent, and</li>
<li>The parent process ID of the child.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since any program we write does not have specific knowledge of the parent process, the test program needs to be both the parent and the child. Fortunately this can be done with the <code>fork()</code> system call. Using <code>fork()</code> will allow the test program to be both the parent and the child.</p>
<p>Of course, since your program will be calling <code>fork()</code>, you must also call <code>wait(int *)</code> to make sure the child is properly cleaned up. Every process that terminates must call the <code>exit(int)</code> API. In addition to releasing all the process memory, it allows the process to provide a return code. This integer can signify success (usually 0) or failure (usually 1 or -1) or any value that makes sense.</p>
<p>But if the process memory is released where should the return code be stored? In xv6 the return code is stored in the <code>xstate</code> member of the process structure. The process is then set to a ZOMBIE state, as the process is dead but not completely gone (the process structure is still in use).</p>
<p>To make the process structure available again, another process must call the <code>wait(int *)</code> API. The integer pointer parameter allows the <code>wait(int *)</code> API to store the content of <code>xstate</code> in the process structure into a variable usable to the caller. Once the ZOMBIE process state has been copied to an integer variable, the process structure can be set to UNUSED, officially freeing the structure for any new process. The <code>wait(int *)</code> call can be made by the parent in the following way:</p>
<pre>int ret = 0;<br>wait(&amp;ret);<br>printf(""The child return code is %d\n"", ret);</pre>
<p>If the parent process does not properly call <code>wait(int *)</code> to clean up after it's children, then another process must be responsible. Any time a parent process terminates without waiting on it's children, those children are reassigned to the granddaddy of all processes, the <code>init</code> process (process #1). The <code>init</code> process constantly waits for abandoned children processes to come along. These abandon children are known as <strong>orphan processes</strong>. This abandonment can happen while the child is still running or when it has terminated. In either case, <code>init</code> will wait for the child to terminate and clean up after it.</p>
<p>There are times when a process waiting for a child does not care about the return value of the terminating child. This is the case for the <code>init</code> process (see <code>user/init.c</code> line 42). In this case the universal symbol for ""I don't care"" is sent, the number 0 (known as NULL in other systems). When <code>wait(int *)</code> is about to copy <code>xstate</code> from the zombie process structure, and finds the pointer set to zero (See <code>kernel/proc.c</code> line 411) then it doesn't perform the copy.</p>
<p>Now that you know what is necessary for creating and cleaning up child processes, you can create your <code>getppid</code> test program. The test program should do the following in the <code>main()</code> function:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the current process id with <code>getpid()</code> and store it in a local variable</li>
<li>Call <code>fork()</code></li>
<li>If this is the parent:
<ol>
<li>Wait for the child with <code>wait(int *)</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If this is the child:
<ol>
<li>Get the parent process id with <code>getppid()</code> (you will be creating this system call)</li>
<li>Compare it with the previously-obtained process id</li>
<li>If they match, report success</li>
<li>If they don't match, report failure</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Write your code in the source code file <code>user/assn2.c</code> and update the <code>UPROGS</code> variable in the <code>Makefile</code>. If you've done everything correctly your program will fail to build because you are missing the <code>getppid()</code> system call. If it is failing to build, you've done it right! Stage your files and commit them locally. Now is a good time to push your changes to Bitbucket.</p>
<h2>Creating a System Call</h2>
<p>As was demonstrated in class, there are a few files that need to be modified to add a system call. You will be adding a system call <code>getppid()</code>. Notice the extra 'p' in the call. This is somewhat similar to the <code>getpid()</code> system call, so let's use that as a reference. Start by cleaning up the source directory and searching for all the occurrences of <code>getpid</code>:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">root@xv6:/xv6-riscv# <strong>make clean</strong><br>rm -f *.tex *.dvi *.idx *.aux *.log *.ind *.ilg \<br>*/*.o */*.d */*.asm */*.sym \<br>user/initcode user/initcode.out kernel/kernel fs.img \<br>mkfs/mkfs .gdbinit \<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; user/usys.S \<br>user/_cat user/_echo user/_forktest user/_grep user/_init user/_kill user/_ln user/_ls user/_mkdir user/_rm user/_sh user/_stressfs user/_usertests user/_grind user/_wc user/_zombie<br>root@xv6:/xv6-riscv# <strong>grep -rn getpid kernel</strong><br>kernel/syscall.h:12:#define SYS_getpid 11<br>kernel/sysproc.c:19:sys_getpid(void)<br>kernel/syscall.c:93:extern uint64 sys_getpid(void);<br>kernel/syscall.c:118:[SYS_getpid] &nbsp;sys_getpid,<br>root@xv6:/xv6-riscv# <strong>grep -rn getpid user</strong><br>user/user.h:21:int getpid(void);<br>user/usys.pl:35:entry(""getpid"");<br>user/usertests.c:803: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;getpid();<br>user/usertests.c:908: &nbsp;int master_pid = getpid();<br>user/grind.c:150: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;kill(getpid());</pre>
<p>First run <code>make clean</code>. This will restore the source directory to it's original state. Then search using the <code>grep</code> utility for all instances of <code>getpid</code>. Here are the files we need to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>kernel/syscall.h</code> : Every system call has a unique numeric identifier. The identifier for <code>getpid</code> is 11. We will need to choose an identifier for our new <code>getppid</code> system call and add it to this file. The number that is chosen should be unique from all the other numbers. Just choose the next integer value sequentially. Note that it is prefixed with <code>SYS_</code>. Do not forget to do this.&nbsp;<strong>(one line added to kernel/syscall.h)</strong></li>
<li><code>kernel/syscall.c</code> : There are two additions that must be made to this file:
<ul>
<li>This is where we add the function declaration for our new <code>sys_getppid(void)</code> function. Just like the other functions your declaration should take a void parameter and return a uint64. It should be declared extern just like the other function declarations. The easiest way to finish this is to copy the getpid() declaration and paste it, adding the extra 'p' to the function name.&nbsp;<strong>(one line added to kernel/syscall.c)</strong></li>
<li>We need to associate the function to our system call id number chosen in the previous step. This is done in the declaration of the syscalls variable. Each system call needs an entry that has the system call ID defined in kernel/syscall.h associated with the system call function. It will likely look like this: [SYS_getppid] sys_getppid, Add that to the <code>syscalls</code> array.&nbsp;<strong>(one line added to kernel/syscall.c)</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>user/user.h</code> : You need to add a function declaration for the userspace programs to call. This declaration will be different than the declaration in the kernel code in that it will not be prefixed with <code>sys_</code> and could have parameters (although not in our case). Just copy the function declaration for getpid() and paste it, including an extra ""p"" in the function name.&nbsp;<strong>(one line added to user/user.h)</strong></li>
<li><code>user/usys.pl</code> : This script is a code generation script. It creates stub functions for every system call that will be linked to the userspace programs. When a userspace program makes a system call, the stub function generated by this script will be called. In order for a stub to be created, though, and ""entry"" needs to be made in this script. Just copy the getpid entry and add the letter ""p"".&nbsp;<strong>(one line added to user/usys.pl)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Now we need to actually write the system call. Let's add it to the same source file as <code>sys_getpid(void)</code> is found - <code>kernel/sysproc.c</code>. Here is what the current ""Get Process ID"" system call function looks like:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">uint64
sys_getpid(void)
{
  return myproc()-&gt;pid;
}</pre>
<p>Let's start by writing a stub system call. Just copy this function, but have it return 0 for now. This should allow us to successfully compile, but if we run the test program in <code>xv6</code>, it will fail:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">xv6 kernel is booting

$ assn2
assn2: getppid by John Jolly
FAILURE! Process IDs do not match! 3 != 0</pre>
<p>But it compiles and runs! Call that an initial success. Make sure your assn2 test program output matches what you see above when the system call only returns a zero.</p>
<h2>Committing Changes to Git</h2>
<p>This is an excellent time to commit your changes. Let's see what changes have been made:</p>

<p>Now, no matter how badly you screw up your source code, you can always come back to this commit and try again. Your own personal development checkpoint. You can also save your changes to the Bitbucket repository with the <code>git push student assn2</code> command, assuming your remote name is ""student"".</p>
<h2>Getting the Parent Process ID</h2>
<p>The <code>getpid</code> system call shown above is fairly simple. It just calls the <code>myproc()</code> function and references the pid member of the function return. So what does the <code>myproc()</code> function look like. This can be found in the <code>kernel/proc.c</code> source code:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">// Return the current struct proc *, or zero if none.
struct proc*
myproc(void) {
  push_off();
  struct cpu *c = mycpu();
  struct proc *p = c-&gt;proc;
  pop_off();
  return p;
}</pre>
<p>This function first disables interrupts to this CPU. This is a good idea since a device (like the timer) might interrupt this CPU between getting the cpu structure and getting the process structure. Imagine how awkward it would be for this process to wake up on another CPU and get the process structure from the first CPU.</p>
<p>When finished, this function returns a pointer to the process structure. The definition for the process structure can be found in <code>kernel/proc.h</code>:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">// Per-process state
struct proc {
  struct spinlock lock;

  // p-&gt;lock must be held when using these:
  enum procstate state;        // Process state
  void *chan;                  // If non-zero, sleeping on chan
  int killed;                  // If non-zero, have been killed
  int xstate;                  // Exit status to be returned to parent's wait
  int pid;                     // Process ID

  // wait_lock must be held when using this:
  struct proc *parent;         // Parent process

  // these are private to the process, so p-&gt;lock need not be held.
  uint64 kstack;               // Virtual address of kernel stack
  uint64 sz;                   // Size of process memory (bytes)
  pagetable_t pagetable;       // User page table
  struct trapframe *trapframe; // data page for trampoline.S
  struct context context;      // swtch() here to run process
  struct file *ofile[NOFILE];  // Open files
  struct inode *cwd;           // Current directory
  char name[16];               // Process name (debugging)
};</pre>
<p>Whew! There's a lot going on here. For now focus on the <code>pid</code> member which holds the unique process ID for that process. Also notice the <code>parent</code> member. It's a process structure as well. That means it's as simple as returning <code>myproc()-&gt;parent-&gt;pid</code>, right? Not quite.</p>
<p>Take a look at comment right above the <code>parent</code> member. It mentions that a <code>wait_lock</code> must be held to use the <code>parent</code>. There's a problem we must account for. Consider the following.</p>
<p>Just after the <code>myproc()</code> function successfully returns the process structure for the process running on the current cpu, and the <code>parent</code> member is retrieved, something happens to the parent process. Perhaps while running concurrently on another CPU the parent process decides to exit. That causes the process structure for the parent to be cleared. Suddenly we have an invalid <code>pid</code> value.</p>
<p>Concurrency issues like this can be prevented by using locks. Locks prevent any other concurrent process from accessing the lock. If our current process is holding the <code>wait_lock</code>, then no other process may acquire the lock - even if the process is running on concurrently on another process. We need to acquire that <code>wait_lock</code> before reading the parent process structure.</p>
<p>Let's search for <code>wait_lock</code> in the code using the grep command:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">root@xv6:/xv6-riscv# grep -r wait_lock
kernel/proc.c:struct spinlock wait_lock;
kernel/proc.c:  initlock(&amp;wait_lock, ""wait_lock"");
kernel/proc.c:  acquire(&amp;wait_lock);
kernel/proc.c:  release(&amp;wait_lock);
kernel/proc.c:// Caller must hold wait_lock.
kernel/proc.c:  acquire(&amp;wait_lock);
kernel/proc.c:  release(&amp;wait_lock);
kernel/proc.c:  acquire(&amp;wait_lock);
kernel/proc.c:            release(&amp;wait_lock);
kernel/proc.c:          release(&amp;wait_lock);
kernel/proc.c:      release(&amp;wait_lock);
kernel/proc.c:    sleep(p, &amp;wait_lock);  //DOC: wait-sleep
kernel/proc.h:  // wait_lock must be held when using this:</pre>
<p>Hmm, only one file has access to the <code>wait_lock</code> - <code>kernel/proc.c</code>. The lock is not used in any other source file. In fact it is only accessible from <code>kernel/proc.c</code>. We can't use the <code>wait_lock</code> from the <code>kernel/sysproc.c</code> file where we're creating our <code>getppid</code> system call. This means we need to create an accessor function in <code>kernel/proc.c</code>.</p>
<h2>Writing Kernel Data Accessors</h2>
<p>In order to get the parent process ID we must create a function that will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the current process structure by calling <code>myproc()</code>. Save the pointer to a local variable.</li>
<li>Acquire the <code>wait_lock</code></li>
<li>Save the parent process id in a local variable</li>
<li>Release the <code>wait_lock</code></li>
<li>Return the parent process id (it's in the local variable, remember?)</li>
</ul>
<p>A great example of how to lock, use, and unlock can be found in the <code>fork()</code> function in <code>kernel/proc.c</code>. Here's the relevant piece of code:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">  acquire(&amp;wait_lock);
  np-&gt;parent = p;
  release(&amp;wait_lock);</pre>
<p>In this example, a value is being written to <code>parent</code>. We want to read from <code>parent</code>, so make sure you switch this around.</p>
<p>Now, with your new function in <code>kernel/proc.c</code> that returns the parent process id, we need to add our function declaration to the correct header file, but which one? Well, we know <code>myproc()</code> is usable outside of <code>kernel/proc.c</code>. It needs to be declared somewhere, let's look for it:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">root@xv6:/xv6-riscv# grep -r myproc kernel/*.h
kernel/defs.h:struct proc*    myproc();</pre>
<p>Ahh, <code>kernel/defs.h</code> is the place. Add a line in this file that declares your <code>getppid()</code> function. It should be returning an integer.</p>
<p>We're in the home stretch! Now we can have our system call in <code>kernel/sysproc.c</code> return something other than zero. Just catch the return from the call to the function you created in <code>kernel/proc.c</code> and return it from your system call.</p>
<p>Build <code>xv6</code> and run your test a few times:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">xv6 kernel is booting

<p>If this is what you see, congratulations! You've created a system call. Grab you ""Official Operating System Programmer"" badge! Quick, stage and commit your changes. This is necessary to complete the next step.</p>
<h2>Pushing Your Changes and Submitting to Canvas</h2>
<p>Once you've committed you changes to your local Git repository, you need to push your changes to the Bitbucket remote server. Before pushing your changes to the remote repository, it is a very good idea to make sure your branch status is clean:</p>
<pre>root@xv6:/xv6-riscv# git status<br>On branch assn2<br>Your branch is ahead of 'origin/riscv' by 2 commits.<br>&nbsp; (use ""git push"" to publish your local commits)<br><br>nothing to commit, working tree clean</pre>
<p>Important parts of this output are:</p>
<ul>
<li>That you are looking for the status for the assn2 branch</li>
<li>That your assn2 branch is ""ahead"" of the origin/riscv branch</li>
<li>That the number of commits you have made is shown</li>
<li>That the working tree is clean and there is nothing to commit</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have ""untracked"" files. If so, make sure none of them are files you want to keep. If you have any untracked files you wish to keep, stage them and commit them.</p>
<p>Now that your working tree is clean, you can push your changes to the remote repository:</p>
<pre>root@xv6:/xv6-riscv# git push student assn2</pre>
<p>Once that operation is successful, you may want to log in to Bitbucket and check that your branch can be found and that your changes are in the branch.</p>
<p>Finally, please submit to Canvas a note that indicates you have pushed your changes to your repository. Your assignment&nbsp;<strong>will not be graded</strong> if you do not make this simple Canvas submission. No files need to be submitted, just a note.</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>This is a 25 point assignment. Here is the point breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 points : assignment source pushed to Bitbucket under the <code>assn2</code> branch and source compiles without error</li>
<li>5 points : assn2 test program is found after starting xv6 OS and running the <code>ls</code> command</li>
<li>5 points : getppid system call exists</li>
<li>5 points : parent pid accessed with correct lock acquired</li>
<li>5 points : test program is successful</li>

570909,6965301,Assignment 3 - Implement Lottery Scheduler,"<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118710790/canvas_global_app.css""><h3>Objective</h3>
<p>You will implement the lottery scheduler as described in <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-sched-lottery.pdf"" target=""_blank"">OS:TEP Chapter 9 - Proportional Share Scheduling</a>. You will also create two system calls, one that returns the runtime of a process, and one that allows a process to assign the number of shares to the current process. But first you will write a user-space test program to verify your scheduler.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In class we have gone over the xv6 process scheduler. As you recall the original scheduler loops through the processes looking for a <code>RUNNABLE</code> process, sets it to <code>RUNNING</code> and then performs a context switch to the process. This is a fairly basic scheduler and is much like the Round Robin scheduler since it schedules each process in order, but can be preempted by the CPU timer. The only difference is the Round Robin scheduler orders jobs by their arrival time, where the xv6 scheduler order is dictated by the position of the process structure within the process structure array - only slightly less fair.</p>
<p>The changes you will make to xv6 will implement the Lottery Scheduler that is found in <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-sched-lottery.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Chapter 9 of OS:TEP</a>. You will add a variable to the process structure that contains the number of shares assigned to the process. Initially this variable will be set to the same shares as the parent process. The <code>init</code> process will be set to a default number of shares.</p>
<p>The assignment should follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new branch named <code>assn3</code> from the <code>riscv</code> branch</li>
<li>Add an integer <code>runtime</code> variable to the process structure and a system call to retrieve the <code>runtime</code> value</li>
<li>Create the source code for a user space program that will test your scheduler and name it <code>user/assn3.c</code></li>
<li>Create the stub for the <code>shares</code> system call</li>
<li>Add the <code>shares</code> variable to the process structure, and initialize it in the proper initialization function</li>
<li>In the appropriate function copy the shares from the parent process to the child process when the fork call is made</li>
<li>Write a random number generator</li>
<li>Write a loop to count the total number of shares on <code>RUNNABLE</code> jobs</li>
<li>Choose a random ticket within the range of the total number of tickets</li>
<li>Have the scheduler only choose a job if the random ticket is within the ticket range for the process</li>
<li>Finish the <code>shares</code> system call</li>
</ol>
<h3>Create your new <code>assn3</code> branch</h3>
<p>Before you write any code, you need to create the <code>assn3</code> branch in your local repository based off the <code>riscv</code> upstream branch. Create your new branch and check it out with this command:</p>
<pre><a href=""mailto:root@xv6:/xv6-riscv#"" target=""_blank"">root@xv6:/xv6-riscv#</a> git checkout -b assn3 origin/riscv<br>Branch 'assn3' set up to track remote branch 'riscv' from 'origin'.<br>Switched to a new branch 'assn3'</pre>
<p>The output of this command should reassure you that your are now working in a branch named <code>assn3</code> and that it is ""tracking"" remote branch <code>riscv</code> from the <code>origin</code> remote. You are now ready to write some code.</p>
<h3>Creating a Process Runtime System Call</h3>
<p>In order to test our scheduler, we need a user space program that creates several processes with different shares assigned, and after killing the processes measures the number of times each process was scheduled and compare those times. This means we need to add code that increments a counter each time a process is scheduled. To add this feature, we need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add an integer variable to the process structure named <code>runtime</code>. This is <strong>one line of code</strong> in the <code>kernel/proc.h</code> file</li>
<li>Initialize our new <code>runtime</code> variable to 0 in the <code>allocproc</code> function. This is <strong>one line of code</strong> in the <code>kernel/proc.c</code> file</li>
<li>Increment our new <code>runtime</code> variable in the <code>scheduler</code> function. This is <strong>one line of code</strong> in the <code>kernel/proc.c</code> file</li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to create a system call that allows the parent process to read the <code>runtime</code> variable of another process. This system call should take one parameter, an integer, that will be the ID of the process where we need to get the <code>runtime</code> value.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new system call named <code>int getrt(int)</code> that returns the value of runtime. Refer to your assignment 2 for how to create a system call. This will modify the following files:
<ul>
<li><code>user/user.h</code> - <strong>one line of code</strong></li>
<li><code>user/usys.pl</code> - <strong>one line of code</strong></li>
<li><code>kernel/syscall.h</code> - <strong>one line of code</strong></li>
<li><code>kernel/syscall.c</code> - <strong>two lines of code</strong></li>
<li><code>kernel/proc.c</code> - Add this function <strong>fifteen lines of code</strong>:<br>
<ul>
<li>
<pre>int<br>getprocruntime(int pid) {<br>  struct proc *p;<br>  int runtime = -1;<br><br>  for(p = proc; p &lt; &amp;proc[NPROC] &amp;&amp; runtime &lt; 0; p++) {<br>  &nbsp; acquire(&amp;p-&gt;lock);<br>  &nbsp; if(pid == p-&gt;pid) {<br>  &nbsp; &nbsp; runtime = p-&gt;runtime;<br>  &nbsp; }<br>  &nbsp; release(&amp;p-&gt;lock);<br>  }<br><br>  return runtime;<br>}</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>kernel/defs.h</code> - one line of code that should look like this:
<ul>
<li>
<pre>int &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; getprocruntime(int);</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>kernel/sysproc.c</code> - No more than <strong>six lines of code&nbsp;</strong>that should look like this:
<ul>
<li>
<pre>uint64<br>sys_getrt(void)<br>{<br>  int pid;<br>  argint(0, &amp;pid);<br>  return getprocruntime(pid);<br>}</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This addition will keep track of how many time a process has been scheduled. This is generally when the timer interrupt is triggered, but can also occur when a process makes a system call. For our purposes the test program will be written to trigger the timer interrupt.</p>
<p>I suggest writing a test program for this new <code>getrt(int)</code> system call that has output like this:</p>
<pre>xv6 kernel is booting<br><br>hart 2 starting<br>hart 1 starting<br>init: starting sh<br>$ testgetrt<br>testgetrt by John Jolly<br>Process 3 sleeping for 100 ticks<br>Start ticks == 7<br>End ticks == 107<br>Process 3 tick difference == 100<br>$ testgetrt 50<br>testgetrt by John Jolly<br>Process 4 sleeping for 50 ticks<br>Start ticks == 1<br>End ticks == 51<br>Process 4 tick difference == 50<br>$ testgetrt 250<br>testgetrt by John Jolly<br>Process 5 sleeping for 250 ticks<br>Start ticks == 1<br>End ticks == 251<br>Process 5 tick difference == 250</pre>
<p>The ""ticks"" value in xv6 is the number of times a process has been scheduled. This happens every one-tenth of a second. In order to have the process not do work for a certain number of ticks, you will need to use the <code>sleep(int)</code> API. The integer parameter is the number of ticks your process will wait before being scheduled again and doing more work.</p>
<p>Please note this is not the test program you need to write for testing the scheduler, and this test program is not required for your assignment. You're just adding a new feature we need to write the required test program for the new scheduler, and you should test the new process runtime feature.</p>
<p>This is a good time to stage and commit your new process runtime system call.</p>
<h3>Create the User Space Test Program for the New Scheduler</h3>
<p>First make sure you have a simple user space program created in <code>user/assn3.c</code> that just prints the assignment title and your name. This is just a stub program that you will fill in shortly. Follow the instructions from previous assignments. Don't forget to update <code>Makefile</code>. Your output in xv6 should look like this (with the name changed, obviously):</p>
<pre>xv6 kernel is booting<br><br>hart 1 starting<br>hart 2 starting<br>init: starting sh<br>$ assn3<br>assn3 by John Jolly<br>$</pre>
<p>If that runs successfully, stage your changes and commit them to your Git repository.</p>
<p>In order to test the scheduler, we want to make CPU-bound processes each with a different share value assigned. This will force the timer interrupt to trigger and the scheduler to run. The easiest way to create a CPU-bound process is to loop infinitely with the simple loop <code>for(;;);</code>. If several child processes are created that set their share value with the <code>shares</code> system call and loop forever, then the parent can call the <code>kill</code> system call to terminate those children. Once all the child processes have been killed, the parent can call the <code>getrt</code> system call on the children to find how many times the processes were scheduled. Then the parent can clean up the killed children using the <code>wait</code> system call.</p>
<p>Here are the tasks the test program should accomplish:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create three child processes and store in variables the three process IDs returned by <code>fork</code>
<ul>
<li>Each child process should call the <code>shares</code> system call that will set the child process shares
<ul>
<li>The number of shares should be 10 for the first child, 20 for the second, and 30 for the third</li>
<li>You will create this system call for your new scheduler later in this assignment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After setting the process shares, loop forever in your child process
<ul>
<li>You do not need to call <code>exit</code> from the child, as the loop will not allow anything to be executed in the child process</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the parent process creates the three child processes, the parent should call the <code>sleep</code> system call for 300 ticks (30 seconds)</li>
<li>After the call to <code>sleep</code> returns, call the <code>kill</code> system call using the process IDs returned by <code>fork</code> for each of the three children</li>
<li>For each of the child processes, call the <code>getrt</code> system call using the process IDs returned by <code>fork</code>. Display the value returned by <code>getrt</code></li>
<li>For each of the child processes, call the <code>wait</code> system call to clean up the process structures. Pass <code>0</code> as the parameter as we do not care about the process exit status</li>
</ul>
<p>At first, your test program will not compile as you have not created the <code>shares</code> system call. This is to be expected. Stage and commit your changes and let's fix the compile problem.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Create the Stub for the <code>shares</code>&nbsp;System Call</h3>
<p>This will be similar to the <code>getppid</code> assignment where you modify the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>kernel/syscall.c</code> - The declaration for the kernel system call function.&nbsp;<strong>Two lines added</strong></li>
<li><code>kernel/syscall.h</code> - The system call number. Name it <code>SYS_shares</code>. <strong>One line added</strong></li>
<li><code>kernel/sysproc.c</code> - Your system function definition. Name it <code>sys_shares</code>. You will add to this function later, but for now it should be no more than <strong>three to five lines added</strong></li>
<li><code>user/user.h</code> - The system call declaration in userspace. Name it <code>shares</code> to return <code>int</code> and take an <code>int</code> parameter. <strong>One line added</strong></li>
<li><code>user/usys.pl</code> - The system call definition in userspace. Add an <code>entry(...)</code>.&nbsp;<strong>One line added</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This call will take an integer as a parameter and return an integer for status (0 for success, -1 for error). For now just return -1. Since the system call is not complete, it would be an error to use it. The test program will react appropriately for an error.</p>
<p>When you're done add the files for staging and commit your changes:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">root@xv6:/xv6-riscv# git add kernel/user.h kernel/usys.pl kernel/syscall.h kernel/syscall.c kernel/sysproc.c
root@xv6:/xv6-riscv# git commit -m 'Create shares system call'
</pre>
<p>Now the test program can be run. For this to be an effective test, you need to limit the CPUs of the system to one instead of the usual three. You can do this by running the xv6 operating system with the following addition:</p>
<pre>$ make CPUS=1 qemu</pre>
<p>Your test program should now build successfully and you should get the following output:</p>
<pre>xv6 kernel is booting<br><br>init: starting sh<br>$ assn3<br>assn3 by John Jolly<br>Allowing child processes to run for 300 ticks (30 seconds)<br>Share value for process 6 failed to set<br>Share value for process 4 failed to set<br>Share value for process 5 failed to set<br>Process 4 with 10 shares ran for 1 ticks<br>Process 5 with 20 shares ran for 1 ticks<br>Process 6 with 30 shares ran for 1 ticks</pre>
<p>First, notice that you do not see <code>hart 1 starting</code> or <code>hart 2 starting</code>. Adding <code>CPUS=1</code> to <code>make qemu</code> causes the emulator to launch with only one emulated CPU. This can also be used in <code>make qemu-gdb</code> if you wish to debug a single-processor system.</p>
<p>Second, you should see the output of your test program <code>assn3</code> with the runtime ticks of your three child processes. Note that the children only ran for one tick. This is because they should exit immediately after reporting the error. Also note the errors are out-of-order, with process 6 reporting first. This is because our scheduler is <strong>nondeterministic</strong>. This means you can't predict in what order processes will be scheduled. Don't be worried about the values right now. In fact, they will change dramatically once the scheduler has been changed.</p>
<p>If you have things working well at this point, stage and commit your changes. Don't forget to push your changes to your <code>student</code> branch for the sake of a backup.</p>
<h3>Add <code>shares</code>&nbsp;Variable to the Process Structure and Initialize</h3>
<p>Now we need to modify the process structure. Let's take a look at the structure. Edit the <code>kernel/proc.h</code> file and go to the bottom of the file where struct proc is declared:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source""> 84 // Per-process state<br>&nbsp;85 struct proc {<br>&nbsp;86 &nbsp; struct spinlock lock;<br>&nbsp;87<br>&nbsp;88 &nbsp; // p-&gt;lock must be held when using these:<br>&nbsp;89 &nbsp; enum procstate state; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// Process state<br>&nbsp;90 &nbsp; void *chan; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// If non-zero, sleeping on chan<br>&nbsp;91 &nbsp; int killed; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// If non-zero, have been killed<br>&nbsp;92 &nbsp; int xstate; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// Exit status to be returned to parent's wait<br>&nbsp;93 &nbsp; int pid; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Process ID<br> 94   int runtime;                 // Number of ticks elapsed since start of process<br> 95<br> 96 &nbsp; // wait_lock must be held when using this:<br> 97 &nbsp; struct proc *parent; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Parent process<br> 98<br> 99 &nbsp; // these are private to the process, so p-&gt;lock need not be held.<br>100 &nbsp; uint64 kstack; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Virtual address of kernel stack<br>101 &nbsp; uint64 sz; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Size of process memory (bytes)<br>102 &nbsp; pagetable_t pagetable; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // User page table<br>103 &nbsp; struct trapframe *trapframe; // data page for trampoline.S<br>104 &nbsp; struct context context; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// swtch() here to run process<br>105 &nbsp; struct file *ofile[NOFILE]; &nbsp;// Open files<br>106 &nbsp; struct inode *cwd; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Current directory<br>107 &nbsp; char name[16]; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Process name (debugging)<br>108 };</pre>
<p>There are three sections to this structure.</p>
<ol>
<li>The top has variables that may be accessed by other processes (lines 89-94). Any process that accesses one of these variables should hold the lock on this structure.</li>
<li>The middle section has the pointer to the parent structure (line 97). This must be locked globally, unlike the first section. In the first section there may be only two processes that need to lock the structure, but the middle section could have any process trying to modify the parent structure.</li>
<li>Finally the third section has variables that no other process will be accessing except the owning process (lines 100-107).</li>
</ol>
<p>Our <code>shares</code> variable will be accessed by other processes when they are gathering the total number of shares. This is only a contention between the scheduling process and the owning process, so the <code>shares</code> variable should be assigned to the first section. Just add this line to the structure after the <code>int runtime;</code> line (line 94):</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">  int shares;                 // Share count. Added for assignment 3</pre>
<p>This should only be&nbsp;<strong>one line of code</strong>.</p>
<p>It is critical that this variable be initialized properly. There are two places where it should be initialized:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first process that is created</li>
<li>When a child process is forked</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the source file <code>kernel/proc.c</code> you will find a function named <code>userinit</code>:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">231 // Set up first user process.<br>232 void<br>233 userinit(void)<br>234 {<br>235 &nbsp; struct proc *p;<br>236<br>237 &nbsp; p = allocproc();<br>238 &nbsp; initproc = p;<br>239<br>240 &nbsp; // allocate one user page and copy initcode's instructions<br>241 &nbsp; // and data into it.<br>242 &nbsp; uvmfirst(p-&gt;pagetable, initcode, sizeof(initcode));<br>243 &nbsp; p-&gt;sz = PGSIZE;<br>244<br>245 &nbsp; // prepare for the very first ""return"" from kernel to user.<br>246 &nbsp; p-&gt;trapframe-&gt;epc = 0; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// user program counter<br>247 &nbsp; p-&gt;trapframe-&gt;sp = PGSIZE; &nbsp;// user stack pointer<br>248<br>249 &nbsp; safestrcpy(p-&gt;name, ""initcode"", sizeof(p-&gt;name));<br>250 &nbsp; p-&gt;cwd = namei(""/"");<br>251<br>252 &nbsp; p-&gt;state = RUNNABLE;<br>253<br>254 &nbsp; release(&amp;p-&gt;lock);<br>255 }</pre>
<p>This function sets up and starts the first process, <code>init</code>. Several variables of the process structure are initialized here. Once everything is initialized, the process lock is released. You need to initialize the process <code>shares</code> value in this function.</p>
<p>You will want to set a default value for shares between the <code>allocproc()</code> and the <code>release(&amp;p-&gt;lock)</code>. I would suggest setting the <code>shares</code> value just before the line <code>p-&gt;state = RUNNABLE</code>. Set <code>shares</code> to 1000000. Such a high shares value will ensure that <code>init</code>, <code>sh</code>, and the parent <code>assn3</code> process will run with little to no interruption when needed. <strong>One line of code added</strong>.</p>
<p>Even with two lines of change, you should stage and commit your code.</p>
<h3>Copy the Parent <code>shares</code>&nbsp;Value to the Child <code>shares</code></h3>
<p>The second place to initialize the <code>shares</code>&nbsp;value is also in <code>kernel/proc.c</code> within the <code>fork()</code> function:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">277 // Create a new process, copying the parent.<br>278 // Sets up child kernel stack to return as if from fork() system call.<br>279 int<br>280 fork(void)<br>281 {<br>282 &nbsp; int i, pid;<br>283 &nbsp; struct proc *np;<br>284 &nbsp; struct proc *p = myproc();<br>285<br>286 &nbsp; // Allocate process.<br>287 &nbsp; if((np = allocproc()) == 0){<br>288 &nbsp; &nbsp; return -1;<br>289 &nbsp; }<br>290<br>291 &nbsp; // Copy user memory from parent to child.<br>292 &nbsp; if(uvmcopy(p-&gt;pagetable, np-&gt;pagetable, p-&gt;sz) &lt; 0){<br>293 &nbsp; &nbsp; freeproc(np);<br>294 &nbsp; &nbsp; release(&amp;np-&gt;lock);<br>295 &nbsp; &nbsp; return -1;<br>296 &nbsp; }<br>297 &nbsp; np-&gt;sz = p-&gt;sz;<br>298<br>299 &nbsp; // copy saved user registers.<br>300 &nbsp; *(np-&gt;trapframe) = *(p-&gt;trapframe);<br>301<br>302 &nbsp; // Cause fork to return 0 in the child.<br>303 &nbsp; np-&gt;trapframe-&gt;a0 = 0;<br>304<br>305 &nbsp; // increment reference counts on open file descriptors.<br>306 &nbsp; for(i = 0; i &lt; NOFILE; i++)<br>307 &nbsp; &nbsp; if(p-&gt;ofile[i])<br>308 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; np-&gt;ofile[i] = filedup(p-&gt;ofile[i]);<br>309 &nbsp; np-&gt;cwd = idup(p-&gt;cwd);<br>310<br>311 &nbsp; safestrcpy(np-&gt;name, p-&gt;name, sizeof(p-&gt;name));<br>312<br>313 &nbsp; pid = np-&gt;pid;<br>314<br>315 &nbsp; release(&amp;np-&gt;lock);<br>316<br>317 &nbsp; acquire(&amp;wait_lock);<br>318 &nbsp; np-&gt;parent = p;<br>319 &nbsp; release(&amp;wait_lock);<br>320<br>321 &nbsp; acquire(&amp;np-&gt;lock);<br>322 &nbsp; np-&gt;state = RUNNABLE;<br>323 &nbsp; release(&amp;np-&gt;lock);<br>324<br>325 &nbsp; return pid;<br>326 }</pre>
<p>The two variables that are important in this function are the <code>p</code> and <code>np</code> variables. The <code>p</code> variable is set to the return of <code>myproc()</code>, the process that is calling <code>fork</code> in the first place (line 284). The <code>np</code> variable is set to the process structure allocated for the new process by <code>allocproc()</code> and already has a lock acquired for the structure (line 287). Right after allocating the process structure the user memory is copied from the current process to the new process (line 292). If an error happens, then everything is reversed and an error is returned (lines 293-295). This is the only place an error can happen, so after this point is a safe place to put the <code>shares</code> value copy. Something simple is all that is necessary - like the line that copies the process size (line 297). Just copy the <code>shares</code>&nbsp;value from the <code>p</code> structure to the <code>np</code> structure. A great place to add this line would be just after the <code>np-&gt;sz = p-&gt;sz</code> line (line 297). <strong>Add one line of code</strong>.</p>
<p>Stage and commit your change. You'll be glad you did.</p>
<h3>Create a Random Number Generator</h3>
<p>The xv6 operating system does not come with a random number generator, and there is no library like the standard library to pull from. We need to write our own random number generator. I would suggest writing your new RNG in the <code>kernel/proc.c</code> file, right before the <code>scheduler</code> function.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An easy-to-implement RNG is <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift"" target=""_blank"">the <code>xorshift</code> generator</a>. The algorithm is shown in C on the <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift"" target=""_blank"">Wikipedia page</a> and can be used in your code. There are several versions of this algorithm, but you should be fine with the <code>xorshift32</code> function.</p>
<p>Please notice that the <code>state</code> structure is really just the last random number generated. This is extra complexity that is not necessary. Instead of using the <code>state</code> structure, just make the input parameter for the function the type <code>uint32</code>. In fact, if you name the variable <code>x</code> you can just eliminate all lines of code that use the structure.</p>
<p>If you change the input parameter of the RNG to <code>uint32</code>, you can make the state a local variable to the scheduler function initialized to any value you like. My favorite is:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">  uint32 seed = 0xdeadbeef;</pre>
<p>Create this variable at the top of the <code>scheduler</code> function, just after <code>struct cpu *c</code> is initialized is a good place. Then just call your function like this:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">    seed = xorshift32(seed);</pre>
<p>You will need a new random number each time the scheduler iterates over it's infinite loop. Place your call just inside this loop at the top of the loop body. Stage and commit your changes (sounding like a broken record, aren't I?).</p>
<h3>Interlude - Compiler Optimizer Defeats Debugger</h3>
<p>If you've added this code you should be able to compile and run xv6. If you try to debug your RNG function you will run into a problem:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">0x0000000000001000 in ?? ()
(gdb) b xorshift32 
Breakpoint 1 at 0x80001ec8: file kernel/proc.c, line 433.
(gdb) c
Continuing.</pre>
<p>The debugger will never reach your breakpoint. This is due to the fact that the <code>Makefile</code> is using a compile option that compiles your xv6 kernel with optimizations. One of those optimizations is unused function call elimination. In our case, we're not using the <code>seed</code> variable in our scheduler, and there are no side-effects. The compiler doesn't see side-effect in the use of the <code>seed</code> variable, so it trims all that unnecessary code. If we wish to debug our code, we need to stop this optimization. There are two ways to do it.</p>
<p>First, we can try causing a side-effect. The <code>xorshift32</code> algorithm explicitly states that the random number seed (the value we're passing into <code>xorshift32</code>) should never be zero. This implies the output should also never be zero. Luckily the compiler doesn't know this. So add this line after getting a random number:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">    if(seed == 0) printf(""seed: %p\n"", (uint64)seed);</pre>
<p>We know the print will never be hit, because the <code>seed</code> variable will never be zero. But the compiler doesn't know that and sees a potential side-effect. So it will not optimize out the call to <code>xorshift32</code>. You should now be able to set a breakpoint on <code>xorshift32</code>:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">0x0000000000001000 in ?? ()
(gdb) b xorshift32 
Breakpoint 1 at 0x80001ec8: file kernel/proc.c, line 433.
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, xorshift32 (x=x@entry=3735928559) at kernel/proc.c:433
435     {
(gdb) p/x x
$1 = 0xdeadbeef
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, xorshift32 (x=x@entry=1199382711) at kernel/proc.c:433
433     {
(gdb) p/x x
$4 = 0x477d20b7</pre>
<p>Notice the seed value is now 0x477d20b7. The random number generator seems to be working.</p>
<p>The second method for disabling compiler optimizations is to edit the <code>Makefile</code>. In the <code>Makefile</code> you will see a line like this:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">CFLAGS = -Wall -Werror -O -fno-omit-frame-pointer -ggdb</pre>
<p>The <code>-O</code> switch is what is causing our debugging problems. Change the line so that optimizations are disabled by changing the switch to <code>-O0</code>:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">CFLAGS = -Wall -Werror -O0 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -ggdb</pre>
<p>You will want to clean your project and rebuild everything:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">root@xv6:/xv6-riscv# make clean
rm -f *.tex *.dvi *.idx *.aux *.log *.ind *.ilg \
*/*.o */*.d */*.asm */*.sym \
user/initcode user/initcode.out kernel/kernel fs.img \
mkfs/mkfs .gdbinit \
        user/usys.S \
user/_cat user/_echo user/_forktest user/_grep user/_init user/_kill user/_ln user/_ls user/_mkdir user/_rm user/_sh user/_stressfs user/_usertests user/_grind user/_wc user/_zombie 
root@xv6:/xv6-riscv# make qemu-gdb<br><br>...<br><br>*** Now run 'gdb' in another window.
qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -bios none -kernel kernel/kernel -m 128M -smp 3 -nographic -drive file=fs.img,if=none,format=raw,id=x0 -device virtio-blk-device,drive=x0,bus=virtio-mmio-bus.0 -S -gdb tcp::25000</pre>
<p>Now you can run <code>gdb-multiarch</code>, set the breakpoint on <code>xorshift32</code>, and continue. The breakpoint should be reached very quickly.</p>
<p>This change was for debugging purposes and doesn't need to be committed to your source code. This is the one time during this assignment you will be told to not bother with committing, so don't get use to it.</p>
<h3>Write Shares-Counting Loop</h3>
<p>The first part of the scheduler should be to count the number of shares in all the running programs. Here is the current scheduler with the random number generator code:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">445 scheduler(void)<br>446 {<br>447 &nbsp; struct proc *p;<br>448 &nbsp; struct cpu *c = mycpu();<br>449  &nbsp;uint32 seed = 0xdeadbeef; // Initializing your random number seed<br>450 <br>451 &nbsp; c-&gt;proc = 0;<br>452 &nbsp; for(;;){<br>453 &nbsp; &nbsp; // Avoid deadlock by ensuring that devices can interrupt.<br>454 &nbsp; &nbsp; intr_on();<br>455<br>456  &nbsp; &nbsp;seed = xorshift32(seed); // Generating a new random number<br>457     uint32 rnd_num = seed; // Not necessary, but helps clarify where to find the random number<br>458 <br>459     /***** YOU MUST ADD THE RUNNABLE PROCESS COUNT LOOP HERE *****/<br>460 &nbsp; &nbsp; for(p = proc; p &lt; &amp;proc[NPROC]; p++) {<br>461 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; acquire(&amp;p-&gt;lock);<br>462 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if(p-&gt;state == RUNNABLE) {<br>463 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Switch to chosen process. &nbsp;It is the process's job<br>464 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // to release its lock and then reacquire it<br>465 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // before jumping back to us.<br>466 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; p-&gt;state = RUNNING;<br>467         p-&gt;runtime++; // You should have added this line earlier in the assignment<br>468 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c-&gt;proc = p;<br>469 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; swtch(&amp;c-&gt;context, &amp;p-&gt;context);<br>470 <br>471 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Process is done running for now.<br>472 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // It should have changed its p-&gt;state before coming back.<br>473 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c-&gt;proc = 0;<br>474 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>475 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; release(&amp;p-&gt;lock);<br>476 &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>477 &nbsp; }<br>478 }</pre>
<p>At the point indicate in the code above add a counter variable and a loop that loops through every process (similar to the loop just below the comment). Make sure you are acquiring and releasing the lock just like the loop below the comment. You only want to include the share counts for processes that are <code>RUNNABLE</code>. Ignore everything else for now. Again, the loop below the comment shows how to test for a <code>RUNNABLE</code> process. When the loop is done, it should have a variable with the total number of shares of all runnable processes.</p>
<p>Stage and commit your first changes to the scheduler.</p>
<h3>Write Scheduler Loop</h3>
<p>This is just a matter of reusing the current scheduler loop. The current implementation is a simple ""grab the next runnable and go"" scheduler, going through every process before starting on the next process. This is a form of the Round Robin scheduler and is fairly common and relatively easy to implement.</p>
<p>Our scheduler is going to check if a runnable process has the random ticket that was selected. How to check for this will be an exercise for the student, but there is a video that provides an explanation. But there is one critical difference in the scheduler beyond the comparison. As mentioned above, the current scheduler operates in a round robin order. Every process gets a chance to run. The difference with our scheduler is once a process has been chosen and allowed to run, it will eventually return to this scheduler. When it returns, our scheduler starts over at the first process and selects a new ticket. We cannot allow the loop to move onto the next process in the list and test if the process has a ticket.</p>
<p>The solution for this is simple. We break out of the loop after the scheduled process returns. Just put a break instruction and another <code>release</code> after the <code>c-&gt;proc = 0</code> like this:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">        // Process is done running for now.
        // It should have changed its p-&gt;state before coming back.
        c-&gt;proc = 0;<br>        release(&amp;p-&gt;lock);<br>        break;
      }      
      release(&amp;p-&gt;lock);</pre>
<p>This will cause the inner loop to stop looping, and allow the outer (infinite) loop to choose a new lottery ticket and schedule a new process.</p>
<p>What is described works but is not efficient. See if you can make a more efficient lottery scheduler.</p>
<p>Once you have made these changes and verified that the xv6 operating system still functions, stage and commit your changes to the scheduler.</p>
<h3>Finish the <code>shares</code>&nbsp;System Call</h3>
<p>To complete the assignment, finish the <code>shares</code>&nbsp;system call. I would suggest using the <code>sys_exit</code> system call as an example how to retrieve the integer parameter. You will likely be editing your system call function in the <code>kernel/sysproc.c</code> source code file.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>sys_exit</code> system call has an odd function call at the start:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source""> 10 sys_exit(void)<br>&nbsp;11 {<br>&nbsp;12 &nbsp; int n;<br>&nbsp;13 &nbsp; argint(0, &amp;n);<br>&nbsp;14 &nbsp; exit(n);<br>&nbsp;15 &nbsp; return 0; &nbsp;// not reached<br>&nbsp;16 }</pre>
<p>Any time this system call is running, it is running in the protected, or kernel mode. The operating system kernel sees memory addresses very differently than processes see memory addresses. In order to get the integer value from the user mode memory into the kernel mode memory the <code>argint</code> function needs to be called.</p>
<p>The <code>argint</code> function takes two parameters. First the index of the parameter. If it was the first parameter passed to the system call, then index 0 is used. If it was the second parameter, index 1, etc. Second is the address of a variable in which to store the value retrieved from user mode memory. This variable should be a function local variable or a global variable accessible in kernel mode memory. In the case of the <code>sys_exit</code> system call this is just a local variable. You will do something similar to get the share value send to the system call.</p>
<p>The <code>sys_exit</code> system call makes a call to another function, and you can do the same. It's not necessary, though. You can easily get the current process structure (<code>myproc</code>), acquire the lock, set the value, and release the lock. All in this system call function.</p>
<p>And remember to return 0 on success. If the argint function fails (it's return is less than zero) then return -1 to indicate an error.</p>
<p>Stage and commit your changes. Last time you are warned, I promise.</p>
<h3>Running the <code>assn3</code>&nbsp;Test Program</h3>
<p>Now you can run the test program and see if your scheduler is producing correct results.</p>
<pre>xv6 kernel is booting<br><br>init: starting sh<br>$ assn3<br>assn3 by John Jolly<br>Allowing child processes to run for 300 ticks (30 seconds)<br>Process 4 with 10 shares ran for 48 ticks<br>Process 5 with 20 shares ran for 96 ticks<br>Process 6 with 30 shares ran for 158 ticks<br>$ assn3<br>assn3 by John Jolly<br>Allowing child processes to run for 300 ticks (30 seconds)<br>Process 8 with 10 shares ran for 45 ticks<br>Process 9 with 20 shares ran for 114 ticks<br>Process 10 with 30 shares ran for 141 ticks</pre>
<p>Processes 1 and 2 are the <code>init</code> program and the shell respectively. Process 3 is the main process for the lottery test. Processes 4, 5, and 6 are all children processes of the main process and all have different shares settings. If you run one iteration of the test, it will wait long enough for the child processes to be schedule enough for roughly five-times their share value. You can see in this example process 4 has 10 shares and was scheduled 48 times. Process 5 had 20 shares and was scheduled 96 times. Process 6 had 30 shares and was scheduled 158 times.</p>
<p>While not required for this assignment, you can make your test program configurable from the command line. For example, this test program takes one argument that will set the number of child processes launched and change the sleep time of the parent:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">$ assn3 6<br>assn3 by John Jolly<br>Allowing child processes to run for 1050 ticks (105 seconds)<br>Process 12 with 10 shares ran for 58 ticks<br>Process 13 with 20 shares ran for 96 ticks<br>Process 14 with 30 shares ran for 145 ticks<br>Process 15 with 40 shares ran for 208 ticks<br>Process 16 with 50 shares ran for 243 ticks<br>Process 17 with 60 shares ran for 300 ticks</pre>
<p>I ran <code>assn3</code> to run with six processes having share values of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60. You can see those processes (12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17) have been scheduled 58, 96, 145, 208, 243, and 300 times respectively. Note how process 17 is exactly a ticks-to-shares ratio of 5:1. But process 16 has a ratio of 4.86:1. This is a result of randomness. You can expect close ratios, but not perfect. An interesting exercise is to add up the ticks for all the child processes and compare the sum with the expected run of 1050 ticks.</p>
<p>I will be running your assignments multiple times and checking the ratios to make sure they are close. If they are consistently between 4:1 and 6:1 you will receive full points.</p>

<h3>Objective:</h3>
<p>In this assignment, you will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new git branch called <code>assn4</code> that is branched from the <code>riscv</code> branch.</li>
<li>Create a definition for the <code>struct meminfo</code> structure in a header file named <code>kernel/meminfo.h</code> which you will use to communicate between the kernel and the user-space program.</li>
<li>Write a user-space program in <code>user/assn4.c</code> that will call your new system call with a structure that will be written to by the kernel. The user space program will then print the memory statistics to the console. Add the user-space test program to the <code>Makefile</code></li>
<li>Write a system call that will gather statistics about system memory and return those statistics to the user-space program in a structure provided by the user-space program.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Create Your <code>assn4</code> Branch</h3>
<pre>git checkout -b assn4 origin/riscv</pre>
<h4>Warning: The next assignment will assume you know how to do this.</h4>

<h3>Layout of RISC-V Physical Memory</h3>
<p>There is information hidden within the kernel protected mode that may be useful to our user space processes. Some of that information deals with how memory is organized within the kernel. For the xv6 operating system, memory is usually organized like this (as explained in <code>kernel/memlayout.h</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Address 0x00001000: The boot ROM:
<ul>
<li>Provided by and run by QEMU when the system starts. Usually just jumps to the start of the kernel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Address 0x02000000: Core Local Interruptor (CLINT):
<ul>
<li>Each CPU has one and manages the timer interrupt (how long to wait and where to jump)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Address 0x0C000000: Platform-Level Interrupt Controller (PLIC):
<ul>
<li>Peripheral interrupts (keyboard, storage, etc.) will come through here on it's way to the interrupt handler</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Address 0x10000000: Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART):
<ul>
<li>Serial communications registers used for keyboard input and console output</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Address 0x10001000: virtio disk:
<ul>
<li>Registers used to communicate to the virtualized storage provided by QEMU. This is emulated hardware</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Address 0x80000000: Start of kernel execution
<ul>
<li>This is where the boot ROM (at 0x1000) jumps to in order to begin execution of the kernel</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Layout of xv6 Kernel in Physical Memory</h3>
<p>Everything after address 0x80000000 is free for the kernel to manage. The kernel breaks up memory into specific usable ranges that you will need to find the sizes of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Size of kernel instructions (text section size)</li>
<li>Size of kernel data (Read-Only Data, Global Initialized, and Global Uninitialized data)</li>
<li>Size of memory that can be allocated for processes</li>
<li>Size of memory currently allocated for all processes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addresses From User Mode Cannot Be Directly Use In Kernel Mode</h3>
<p>There is an important distinction between the address space used by kernel-mode instruction and the address space used by user-mode instructions. To operate properly, operating system kernel instructions need to be able to address all of physical memory. This can be done by turning off the Memory Management Unit (MMU) or by creating kernel-mode page tables. Disabling the MMU also disables per-page memory protections such as the read, write, and execute bits. This is generally considered a bad idea and should be avoided. Therefore the operating system will usually have kernel-mode page tables that are a near-identical match to how the physical memory address space is laid out.</p>
<p>Contrast the kernel-mode memory layout to that of user-mode process memory address spaces. The virtual memory addresses used within a user-space process do not have to match how physical memory is configured. Since there is not a one-to-one match for user-space addresses to kernel-space addresses, any pointer coming to the kernel from user-space via a system call cannot be immediately used by kernel-mode instructions. Some form of address translation needs to happen within the kernel code to get the correct physical address.</p>
<p>For your system call, you will write a system call function that will receive a pointer from the user-space process. To the kernel this value is just a very large integer (<code>uint64</code>) and cannot be used as a pointer until translated. In this assignment you will use two kernel functions that help handle pointers from a user-space program:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getaddr(int, uint64 *)</code>: This function will read the user-space pointer value from user-space memory and store the value into a 64-bit unsigned integer variable.&nbsp;<strong>This is just a number to the kernel. Don't try to use it as a pointer!</strong></li>
<li><code>copyout(pagetable_t, uint64, char *, uint64)</code>: This function will write data from kernel memory into the virtual address space of the user process. The first two parameters are used to translate the user-space address into a physical address, and the second two parameters are the pointer and length of the data to copy from kernel memory into user-space virtual memory</li>
</ul>
<h3>Add <code>struct meminfo</code> to a kernel header</h3>
<p>There are system calls where the kernel needs to write data into the memory of a user-space process. A good example of this is the <code>stat</code> system call. This system call allows the kernel to write information about a file into user-space memory. The memory that is being written is defined by a data structure <code>struct stat</code>. You can see this structure in the file <code>kernel/stat.h</code>.</p>
<p>For the system call you will write, a structure data type must be defined that will hold the data that will be shared with the user-space process. The system call function will allocate memory in the kernel stack (local variable) for the structure, write values to that structure, then copy the entire structure memory from kernel memory into the process virtual memory.</p>
<p>Create a new file named <code>kernel/meminfo.h</code> and add the following structure definition to this file:</p>
<pre>struct meminfo {<br>  uint32 kerneltextsize;<br>  uint32 kerneldatasize;<br>  uint32 totalallocsize;<br>  uint32 totalprocsize;<br>  uint32 freememory;<br>  uint32 currentprocsize;<br>};</pre>
<p>You will include this header in both your user-space test program as well as in the kernel system call function.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Create the User-Space Test Program</h3>
<p>You need to create a new test program in <code>user/assn4.c</code> that includes the following headers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>kernel/types.h&nbsp; &nbsp;// Must be included before the meminfo.h header</code></li>
<li><code>kernel/meminfo.h // Contains the structure definition your test program will use</code></li>
<li><code>user/user.h&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Contains the system call declaration to get memory information</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Create the basic <code>main</code> function that prints the program name and your name. Add it to the <code>Makefile</code> and make sure it builds and runs in xv6.</p>
<p>Now add the code that defines an instance of the <code>struct meminfo</code> and make sure it compiles. You will use this structure as a parameter to your new system call. Add the lines of code that will print the structure values. Build it and run it. You should see something like this:</p>
<pre>$ assn4<br>assn4 by John Jolly<br>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;          Section Size<br>------------------------ ----<br>Kernel Text Segment Size 0<br>Kernel Data Segment Size 0<br> Kernel Allocatable Size 0<br>Process Allocated Memory 0<br>  &nbsp;          Free Memory 0<br>    Current Process Size 0</pre>
<p>Don't worry if you're getting different values for your output right now. You haven't written the code to modify the structure. In fact, your test program will not be writing anything to this structure. That's the purpose of the system call you will write.</p>
<p>Now add the call to your system call. You want to send the structure in as a reference. If you declared your <code>meminfo</code> structure variable as <code>minfo</code>, your call should look like this:</p>
<pre>int err = getminfo(&amp;minfo);</pre>
<p>Make sure you check the <code>err</code> variable for a negative value. That will indicate that something went wrong.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Creating the System Call Function</h3>
<p>Your <code>getminfo</code> system call signature should look like this:</p>
<pre>struct meminfo;<br>int getminfo(struct meminfo *);</pre>
<p>Remember that the actual system call function in the kernel will look different from this. This function declaration identifies the parameters that the system call is expecting. The actual system call handler function in the xv6 kernel will not have any parameters, so you will need to get the address of the user-space <code>struct meminfo</code> structure by using the <code>argaddr(int, uint64 *)</code> function. It takes two parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The index of the argument to retrieve
<ul>
<li>There's only one argument, so there's only one possibility. Remember we're working with zero-based indexes)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A pointer to a <code>uint64</code> which will contain the address.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>sys_wait</code> function in <code>kernel/sysproc.c</code> is a great example of how to make this work.</p>
<p>To get the memory information into the user-space process, your system call function needs to have a corresponding structure allocated in kernel memory. You can do this by declaring a local variable of type <code>struct meminfo</code> just like you did in your test program. Assign the appropriate values into this local structure, then use the <code>copyout</code> function to copy the values in the local structure to the structure in user-space pointed to by the address received by the <code>argaddr</code> function. The <code>copyout</code> signature looks something like this:</p>
<pre id=""hterm:copy-to-clipboard-source"">int                                                   
copyout(pagetable_t pagetable, uint64 dstva, char *src, uint64 len);</pre>
<p>You will get the <code>pagetable</code> from the process structure <code>pagetable</code> variable (the <code>myproc()</code> function will help here). The <code>dstva</code> is the <code>uint64</code> value you retrieved from user-space using the <code>argaddr</code> function. The <code>src</code> is the address to the local <code>meminfo</code> structure variable you just populated with data. The <code>len</code> parameter is the size of the <code>meminfo</code> structure (you can find the size of any datatype by using the <code>sizeof</code> operation).</p>
<p>In short, this function copies <code>len</code> bytes of data from <code>src</code> to the virtual address <code>dstva</code> that can be found in kernel memory by walking the process <code>pagetable</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Calculating Memory Statistics</h3>
<p>You can fill in the structure by calculating the memory statistics by observing:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the difference between <code>KERNBASE</code> found in <code>kernel/memlayout.h</code> and <code>etext</code> that is generated at compile time by the code in <code>kernel/kernel.ld</code>
<ul>
<li>This will be the size of the text (code) segment of our kernel&nbsp;</li>
<li>The <code>etext</code> variable will not be accessible to your system call function until you declare <code>extern char etext[];</code></li>
<li>You can also write a function in the <code>kernel/vm.c</code> that performs the calculation for you. This is because <code>etext</code> is declared extern within that file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the difference between <code>etext</code> and <code>end</code> as generated within&nbsp;<code>kernel/kernel.ld</code>
<ul>
<li>This will be the size of the read-only and global variables of our kernel</li>
<li>You have the same problem with <code>end</code> as you did with <code>etext</code>. Declare it extern in the same source as your system call function</li>
<li>As with <code>etext</code>, you can write a function in <code>kernel/vm.c</code> that performs this calculation for you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the difference between <code>end</code> and the maximum kernel memory as specified by <code>PHYSTOP</code>
<ul>
<li>This will be the kernel allocatable size</li>
<li>The PHYSTOP macro is defined in <code>kernel/memlayout.h</code>, which should be included in the system call source</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the sum of sizes (the <code>sz</code> variable) for every process structure that is not <code>UNUSED</code>
<ul>
<li>You can access the array of processes one of two ways:
<ul>
<li>Create a function in <code>kernel/proc.c</code> that loops through the process array, summing the <code>sz</code> variables of all processes that are not <code>UNUSED</code></li>
<li>Declare <code>proc</code> extern to the system call source and create your summing loop in the system call function</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The size variable in the process structure needs the process structure <code>lock</code> to be acquired before being read. This is documented in the process structure definition in <code>kernel/proc.h</code></li>
<li>How do you loop through all the processes? How do you check if a process structure is <code>UNUSED</code>?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You now have the total memory, the space taken by the kernel, and the space taken by the processes. What is left is the free space.</li>
<li>What is the current process size
<ul>
<li>Obtained from the current process structure.\
<ul>
<li>What function do you call to get the current process structure?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tasks:</h3>
<p>Here is a list of things you will need to accomplish for this assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create the <code>getminfo</code> system call
<ul>
<li>This system call will take one parameter: a pointer to a <code>struct meminfo</code> structure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Calculate the kernel text segment and data segment sizes</li>
<li>Calculate the total allocatable memory available to the xv6 operating system kernel</li>
<li>Calculate the total memory used by all active processes</li>
<li>Calculate the total free memory of the system</li>
<li>Calculate the current process size</li>
<li>Populate a local <code>struct meminfo</code> structure variable with the values found above</li>
<li>Copy the entire local <code>struct meminfo</code> structure variable from kernel memory into the user-space <code>struct meminfo</code> structure variable</li>
<li>Return success from the system call if there were no problems. Return <code>-1</code> otherwise</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hints:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You will be access data all over the kernel: from <code>kernel/vm.c</code> to <code>kernel/memlayout.h</code> and more. There are many ways to get this information, and I will leave it up to you, the student, to figure out how to get that information.
<ul>
<li>The most reliable way is to create ""getter"" functions in the various source modules and call those functions from your system call to get the values. Remember to add any new functions declarations to <code>kernel/defs.h</code> so they are ""visible"" to other source modules.</li>
<li>Declaring variables as <code>extern</code> in the system call handler source file is another way</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When looping through the processes, <code>acquire</code> and <code>release</code> the process structure <code>lock</code> when accessing any data members.</li>
<li>You will need to use type casting to convert data types. Specifically:
<ul>
<li>The <code>etext</code> and <code>end</code> values are pointers and need to be cast to <code>uint64</code> before any math can be done</li>
<li>The reference to the <code>struct meminfo</code> structure will need to be cast to a character pointer in the <code>copyout</code> function</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This demonstration uses the <code>grind</code> program to consume memory and resources. This is an excellent test program that stresses the resources of a running xv6 system. The ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>) after <code>grind</code> tells the xv6 shell to run <code>grind</code> in the background and bring back the prompt to allow the user to execute more commands. Our test program demonstrates that almost 100Kb of memory is used by the <code>grind</code> process.</p>
<h3>Submission:</h3>
<p>Stage and commit your changes to the <code>assn4</code> branch of your local repository. Before you push to your upstream Bitbucket repository, validate your branch by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performing a <code>git status</code> and make sure there are no untracked, unstaged, or uncommitted changes you want to keep.</li>
<li>Clean out your build environment with <code>make clean</code></li>
<li>Start xv6 one more time with <code>make qemu</code></li>
<li>Run your test program <code>assn4</code> and verify you are getting correct results</li>
</ul>
<p>If those steps work successfully, push your branch to Bitbucket and submit a note in Canvas letting the grader know you are done.</p>

<h2>Details:</h2>
<h3>Getting set up</h3>
<h4>1. <strong>Create an <code>assn5</code> branch based from <code>origin/riscv</code></strong></h4>
<p>You should be comfortable doing this now.</p>

<ol style=""list-style-type: decimal;"">
<li>In VIM, type the command <code>:set paste</code>

</ol>
<h4>5.&nbsp;<strong>Turn off optimizations in the Makefile</strong></h4>
<p>Compiler optimization will cause problems with this assignment. You need to turn off optimizations by changing the <code>-O</code> (capital O) switch on line 59 to <code>-O0</code> (Capital O, zero). The line should look like this when you're done:</p>
<pre>CFLAGS = -Wall -Werror -O0 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -ggdb -gdwarf-2</pre>
<h4>4.<strong> Add <code>_assn5</code> to <code>UPROGS</code> in the Makefile</strong></h4>
<p>You should be able to build and run the test program. When you run the <code>assn5</code> program you should expect it to fail</p>
<h3>Adding the shared memory functionality</h3>
<p>The design requirements for shared memory are:</p>
<ul>
<li>System should provide four or more individual pages of memory in total
<ul>
<li>Pages should be identified using an integer between 0 and one less than the total pages</li>
<li>For example, if four pages are provided, then they should be identified using 0, 1, 2, and 3</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shared memory pages should persist after a process terminates</li>
<li>Shared memory pages should persist in the virtual address space of both parent and child processes after calling <code>fork</code></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Hints on implementation</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>System should pre-allocate shared memory pages during kernel startup&nbsp;<strong>(Mr. Jolly's Implementation: 6 lines)</strong>
<ul>
<li>This can be done using a function created in <code>kernel/vm.c</code> specifically for this purpose</li>
<li>All it should do is call <code>kalloc</code> for each share page and assign the address to an array</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When the system call is made, the identified shared page should be added to the process page table&nbsp;<strong>(Mr. Jolly's Implementation: 14 lines)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Create a new function in <code>kernel/proc.c</code> that finds the process page table, sends it to the shared memory allocator, and updates any <code>struct proc</code> variables
<ul>
<li>You may be tempted to perform page mapping functionality here. Try to avoid that temptation. The <code>kernel/proc.c</code> file is intended for process related activity, not for page table manipulation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a new function in <code>kernel/vm.c</code> that assigns the identified page to the process table
<ul>
<li>Avoid adding process-related functionality here. This file does not ""know"" about the process structure, and shouldn't.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You will use the <code>mappages(pagetable, virtual_addr, num_pages, physical_addr, permissions)</code> api to assign a physical page frame address to a process page table.
<ul>
<li><code>pagetable</code> - You should use the <code>pagetable</code> of the process that can be accessed by the function in <code>kernel/proc.c</code></li>
<li><code>virtual_addr</code> - Again, the process should know which virtual address is available. This can either be a static address near the highest address in memory, or simply where the current end of heap memory is for the process</li>
<li><code>num_pages</code> - Just assign one page at a time to the process</li>
<li><code>physical_addr</code> - The physical address should have been allocated during the kernel startup</li>
<li><code>permissions</code> - Set this to <code>PTE_U | PTE_R | PTE_W</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The system call should return the virtual address of the first byte of the page
<ul>
<li>This should be the virtual address determined by your system call</li>
<li>The function calls should be <code>system call function</code> → <code>process shared memory allocator</code> → <code>virtual memory shared page mapper</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a process terminates, any shared pages should not be freed with the <code>kfree</code> api&nbsp;<strong>(Mr. Jolly's Implementation: 4 lines)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Specifically, don't let the call to <code>kfree</code> in <code>kernel/vm.c</code> at line 188 happen when the physical page frame address in <code>pa</code> matches the physical page frame address of one of the shared pages</li>
<li>Should be a simple loop to check your share page frame array</li>

<h2>Objective:</h2>
<p>In this assignment you will provide system calls that will help fix the race condition from Assignment 5. You will need to add three system calls to initialize, lock, and unlock a mutex. The system calls will guarantee mutual exclusion after the call to lock for a specific mutex.</p>
<h2>Details:</h2>
<h3>Starting Your Assignment 6 Branch</h3>
<p>You will need to start this assignment using the changes to made for Assignment 5. The command for this is:</p>
<pre>git checkout -b assn6 student/assn5</pre>
<p>This command will checkout, from the <code>assn5</code> branch, a new <code>assn6</code> branch. You may now make changes, stage, commit, and push those changes as you have done with previous assignments</p>
<h3>Writing Your Test Program</h3>
<p>You will create a new test program at <code>user/assn6.c</code></p>
<p>Your test program will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain a shared memory page and initialize an integer in that page to zero.
<ul>
<li>Allocate a shared page using the <code>shmem</code> system call created in Assignment 5. It doesn't matter which page you allocate, but remain consistent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Launch two child processes using the <code>fork</code> system call:
<ul>
<li>One child will increment the shared memory integer one million times</li>
<li>The other child will decrement the shared memory integer one million times</li>
<li>Be aware that the unary increment and decrement operators take precedence before the pointer dereference operator. This means <code>*nval++</code> is an error. If you want to use the pointer dereferece operator, surround it with parantheses like <code>(*nval)++</code> and you shouldn't have any problems.</li>
<li>You can also do <code>nval[0]++</code> as the index operator takes precedence before the unary increment/decrement operators</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The parent will wait for each child to complete</li>
<li>The parent will display the value of the integer in shared memory</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to add your user program in the appropriate place within the <code>Makefile</code> and run it. You should expect a similar output to this:</p>
<pre>xv6 kernel is booting<br><br>hart 1 starting<br>hart 2 starting<br>init: starting sh<br>$ <strong>assn6</strong><br>assn6 Share Memory Test Program by John Jolly<br>Total after loops: 167058<br>$ <strong>assn6</strong><br>assn6 Share Memory Test Program by John Jolly<br>Total after loops: -67521</pre>
<p>Note your output will almost certainly not match the output above, but that's the point. You have written code that has a race condition. You will create a new system call that will provide a mutex to lock the critical section of your new code.</p>
<p>If you are seeing output remotely close to what is shown in the example above, stage and commit your changes in your local git repository.</p>
<h2>Fixing Your Broken Test Program</h2>
<p>Your test program has critical sections that need to be protected with locks. Specifically, you have two threads - one that increments and one that decrements. Is is that increment and decrement code that is the critical section, so a simple mutex should solve our problem.</p>
<h4><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Part 1</strong></span>: Adding The Stub Mutex System Calls API (~30 lines of code)</h4>
<ul>
<li>In this section you will:
<ul>
<li>Create three system calls: mutex init, mutex lock, and mutex unlock</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to provide mutual exclusion, you will create three system call APIs that will have the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mutex Initialization - This system call will allocate an internal data structure that will keep track of the lock state.
<ul>
<li>It will take no parameters and return a handle to the internal data structure.</li>
<li>I'm leaving the naming of the system call to you. While there is no required name for this system call (I'm hoping you'll come up with something original), you are welcome to use the overly-large <code>initialize_mutex_handle</code>. Please try to be more terse that your instructor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mutex Lock - This system call will lock the mutex specified.
<ul>
<li>The system call takes one parameter - the preallocated handle obtained from a call to the mutex initializer.</li>
<li>The lock system call should return 0 on success and -1 if there's an error condition.</li>
<li>The system call will only return if the lock is successfully acquired or there's an error. Otherwise it will block until the lock is released by another process.</li>
<li>Again, use a name that makes sense, or burden yourself with the unnecessarily long <code>lock_mutual_exculsion_handle</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mutex Unlock - This system call will unlock the mutex specified
<ul>
<li>The system call takes one parameter - the preallocated handle from the mutex initializer.</li>
<li>The unlock system call should return 0 on success and -1 if there's an error condition.</li>
<li>This system call should return immediately - no blocking.</li>
<li>Your system call name should make sense, but probably not as long as <code>unlock_mutual_exclusion_handle</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will start by creating stub system call functions. Remember the steps to create a system call (you'll need to follow these steps three times for each of the three system calls described above):</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit <code>user/user.h</code> - Add function declarations for your system calls. (1 line of code per syscall)</li>
<li>Edit <code>user/usys.pl</code> - Add an <code>entry</code> line with the name of each of your system calls. (1 line of code per system call)</li>
<li>Edit <code>kernel/syscall.h</code> - Add a <code>#define</code> that gives each of your system calls a number. (1 line of code per system call)</li>
<li>Edit <code>kernel/syscall.c</code> - Associate your system call number to the system call function within the <code>syscalls</code> array (2 lines of code per system call)</li>
<li>Edit <code>kernel/sysproc.c</code> - Add your system call function definitions here. (5 lines of code per system call)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once those five steps are followed, you should have a buildable system call. Try running xv6 and see if everything builds successfully. Take care to resolve any build errors now, starting with the first error. When you fix the first error, try your build again. Repeat until you've fixed all the build problems.</p>
<p>You are welcome to run your <code>assn6</code> test program but don't expect any different result. You haven't modified <code>assn6</code>&nbsp;to use your system calls yet. That's the next step.</p>
<h4><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Part 2</strong></span>: Modify <code>user/assn6.c</code> (5 lines of code)</h4>
<ul>
<li>In this section you will
<ul>
<li>Call the mutex initialize system call and store the handle</li>
<li>Call lock and unlock around each critical section using the handle previously obtained</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you need to modify the <code>user/assn6.c</code> source code to use your new mutex system calls. First you should call your mutex initializer <strong>before the forks</strong> and assign the result to an integer variable like this <code>int mutex = get_an_initialized_mutex_handle();</code>. I hope your system call name is not that obnoxious. You want to make this call <strong>before</strong> the <code>fork</code>.</p>
<p>When the handle is acquired before the <code>fork</code> (I did mention this, I hope), then the mutex handle will exist in both the parent and the child processes after the fork. This will make it useful for locking and unlocking in different processes later. If the mutex allocation is performed after the <code>fork</code>, then the parent and child processes will have different mutexes and a lock on one mutex will not affect the other mutex.</p>
<p>Now we need to lock the mutex before our critical section and unlock the mutex after our critical section. Something simple like <code>lock_the_mutex_handle(mutex);</code> before both of the increment and decrement operations. Then call <code>unlock_the_mutex_handle(mutex);</code> after the increment and decrement. If your system call names are as long as I am demonstrating here, then you haven't been paying attention to my snarky comments.</p>
<p>Where you place the lock and unlock calls is important. You should only surround the critical sections of your code. Do not protect anything that is not part of your critical section.&nbsp;<strong>You will lose points if you lock anything that is not part of the critical section of your code!</strong></p>
<p>Please note that the API as describe above have error values being returned from <code>lock</code> and <code>unlock</code>. While it's not necessary to check this in this code (we're not deviating from the normal here), you would be wise to check for error returns and handle them accordingly (such as exiting the program). Validating return values is a good habit to form as a programmer.</p>
<h4><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Part</strong><strong> 3</strong></span>:<strong> </strong>Adding a <code>spinlock</code> for our mutex (3 lines of code)</h4>
<ul>
<li>In this section you will
<ul>
<li>Define a spinlock variable</li>
<li>Initialize the spinlock on kernel startup</li>
<li>Declare the spinlock <code>extern</code> in the same file as your system call functions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for our locks to work properly, we will be using the built-in <code>spinlock</code> functionality of the kernel. This functionality is exposed through the <code>acquire</code> and <code>release</code> calls available inside the kernel. The <code>release</code> call is very simple, but the <code>acquire</code> function is where the real work happens. If you look at the <code>acquire</code> code in <code>kernel/spinlock.c</code> you'll see:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;19 // Acquire the lock.<br>&nbsp;20 // Loops (spins) until the lock is acquired.<br>&nbsp;21 void<br>&nbsp;22 acquire(struct spinlock *lk)<br>&nbsp;23 {<br>&nbsp;24 &nbsp; push_off(); // disable interrupts to avoid deadlock.<br>&nbsp;25 &nbsp; if(holding(lk))<br>&nbsp;26 &nbsp; &nbsp; panic(""acquire"");<br>&nbsp;27<br>&nbsp;28 &nbsp; // On RISC-V, sync_lock_test_and_set turns into an atomic swap:<br>&nbsp;29 &nbsp; // &nbsp; a5 = 1<br>&nbsp;30 &nbsp; // &nbsp; s1 = &amp;lk-&gt;locked<br>&nbsp;31 &nbsp; // &nbsp; amoswap.w.aq a5, a5, (s1)<br>&nbsp;32 &nbsp; while(__sync_lock_test_and_set(&amp;lk-&gt;locked, 1) != 0)<br>&nbsp;33 &nbsp; &nbsp; ;<br>&nbsp;34<br>&nbsp;35 &nbsp; // Tell the C compiler and the processor to not move loads or stores<br>&nbsp;36 &nbsp; // past this point, to ensure that the critical section's memory<br>&nbsp;37 &nbsp; // references happen strictly after the lock is acquired.<br>&nbsp;38 &nbsp; // On RISC-V, this emits a fence instruction.<br>&nbsp;39 &nbsp; __sync_synchronize();<br>&nbsp;40<br>&nbsp;41 &nbsp; // Record info about lock acquisition for holding() and debugging.<br>&nbsp;42 &nbsp; lk-&gt;cpu = mycpu();<br>&nbsp;43 }</pre>
<p>Notice at line 32 that the hardware atomic test-and-set intrinsic operation is used. This is useful for us as we do not need to duplicate effort to use hardware atomic operations.</p>
<p>The mutex system call code you write must use a <code>spinlock</code> to protect a new critical section you will create. To use the <code>acquire</code> and <code>release</code> functions, we need to declare a <code>spinlock</code> variable. Our <code>spinlock</code> need to be initialized when the kernel starts up. There are several places for this, but not in <code>kernel/sysproc.c</code> where our system call functions are located. I recommend adding the <code>spinlock</code> variable and initialization in the <code>kernel/proc.c</code> source file. There are several examples how to declare a <code>spinlock</code> such as <code>pid_lock</code> on line 16 and <code>wait_lock</code> on line 27:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;16 struct spinlock pid_lock;<br>&nbsp;17<br>&nbsp;18 extern void forkret(void);<br>&nbsp;19 static void freeproc(struct proc *p);<br>&nbsp;20<br>&nbsp;21 extern char trampoline[]; // trampoline.S<br>&nbsp;22<br>&nbsp;23 // helps ensure that wakeups of wait()ing<br>&nbsp;24 // parents are not lost. helps obey the<br>&nbsp;25 // memory model when using p-&gt;parent.<br>&nbsp;26 // must be acquired before any p-&gt;lock.<br> 27 struct spinlock wait_lock;</pre>
<p>I suggest adding your spinlock after line 27 but before the process initialization function <code>procinit</code> found starting a line 45. Give a name that is shorter than <code>mutex_data_spinlock</code>.</p>
<p>You will need to initialized the spinlock when the kernel is starting up. The <code>main</code> function for our kernel (located oddly enough in <code>kernel/main.c</code>) calls several initialization functions for various parts of our kernel. We could always create our own initialization function, or we could piggy-back on one that already exists. For this assignment we'll choose the <code>procinit</code> function found in the <code>kernel/proc.c</code> kernel source file. In the <code>procinit</code> function:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;45 // initialize the proc table at boot time.<br>&nbsp;46 void<br>&nbsp;47 procinit(void)<br>&nbsp;48 {<br>&nbsp;49 &nbsp; struct proc *p;<br>&nbsp;50<br>&nbsp;51 &nbsp; initlock(&amp;pid_lock, ""nextpid"");<br>&nbsp;52 &nbsp; initlock(&amp;wait_lock, ""wait_lock"");<br>&nbsp;53 &nbsp; for(p = proc; p &lt; &amp;proc[NPROC]; p++) {<br>&nbsp;54 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; initlock(&amp;p-&gt;lock, ""proc"");<br>&nbsp;55 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; p-&gt;kstack = KSTACK((int) (p - proc));<br>&nbsp;56 &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;57 }</pre>
<p>Notice how <code>nextpid</code> on line 51 and <code>wait_lock</code> on line 52 are initialized. Initialize your shorter-than-<code>mutex_data_spinlock</code> variable similar to the other lock initialization. The second parameter is just a readable name for the spinlock and can easily just be the same as the variable name, similar to line 52. Remember to pass a reference to your spinlock as the first parameter, otherwise you will get a compile error.</p>
<p>One last change for our new spinlock is to make the variable visible to our system call functions in <code>kernel/sysproc.c</code>. If your spinlock is named <code>mutex_data_spinlock</code> (I hope not), you need to add this line to the top (but somewhere after <code>#include ""spinlock.c""</code>) of <code>kernel/sysproc.c</code>:</p>
<pre>extern struct spinlock mutex_data_spinlock;</pre>
<h4><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Part 4</strong></span>: Adding the Mutex Data Structure (~4 lines of code)</h4>
<ul>
<li>In this section you will:
<ul>
<li>Define an array for the states of your mutexes</li>
<li>Initialize your mutex state array</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The spinlock is intended to lock a data structure that will contain our mutex lock state. To best decide what data type to use for our mutex, we need to know what is being stored. A mutex lock can be represented by it's state. There are only three states our lock can be in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unallocated - This state means the mutex has not been allocated by a call to your initialize mutex system call</li>
<li>Unlocked - This state means the mutex is allocated, but the lock system call has not been called</li>
<li>Locked - This state means the mutex is allocated and the locked is held by a process</li>
</ul>
<p>We can represent each state as a simple integer value: Zero (0) for uninitialized, one (1) for unlocked, and two (2) for locked. This can easily fit in the unsigned character type. Multiple mutexes can be stored within a character array. When defining an array of a specific size, it's wise to define the size of the array with a macro - similar to the <code>NPROC</code> macro. The <code>assn6</code> test program only opens one mutex, but more would be wise.</p>
<p>In the <code>kernel/proc.h</code> header file, add this line to define our mutex count to 32:</p>
<pre>#define NMUTEX 32</pre>
<p>Now we can create our mutex data structure - which really is an array of characters with a size of <code>NMUTEX</code>. Put this into the <code>kernel/proc.c</code> source code file:</p>
<pre>unsigned char mutex_count_array[NMUTEX];</pre>
<p>and add a loop to the <code>procinit</code> function that sets each array element to zero. Do not miss this step as uninitialized data is always bad.</p>
<p>In order for our system call functions to be able to use this character array, we need to declare it in <code>kernel/sysproc.c</code> just like what was done for the spinlock. Add this line before your system call functions:</p>
<pre>extern unsigned char mutex_count_array[];</pre>
<p>Notice the lack of an actual size for the array. We already defined the size in <code>kernel/proc.c</code>. All that needs to be known here is that this is an array of <code>unsigned char</code> type. Now your system call functions can directly access the <code>mutex_count_array</code>. Again, without this line you will get a compile error.</p>
<h4><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Part 5</strong></span>: Understanding how to Use the xv6 Spinlock Like a Condition Variable (No Code Writing Necessary)</h4>
<p>Now for the tricky part. How do we use our spinlock? In our three system call function, we need to use the spinlock like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mutex Init - The spinlock should be acquired before checking for an unallocated mutex and remain allocated until the mutex is set to unlocked. This way we don't have a race condition where multiple processes are trying to allocate a mutex.</li>
<li>Mutex Lock - This will be tricky. The spinlock should be acquired and the mutex state should be tested for a locked state. If the mutex is locked, the process needs to be stopped until some other process unlocks the mutex - but how do we cause this interprocess communication?</li>
<li>Mutex Unlock - The spinlock should be acquired before setting the mutex state to unlocked. Somehow after the mutex is set to unlocked this process needs to signal any processes blocked waiting that they can check the mutex again. Again, what can we use to do this?</li>
</ul>
<p>There is communication between the Lock and Unlock system call functions that needs to be implemented. Fortunately for us, the xv6 operating system has this ""condition-variable-like"" functionality.</p>
<p>Consider how a parent process will wait for a child to exit by using the <code>wait</code> function. This function does not return until a child process has terminated. This sounds just like the functionality we need - some way to stop one process while waiting for another process to complete a task. In our case it's the lock system call waiting for the unlock system call to unlock the mutex. Let's look at the <code>wait</code> function in <code>kernel/proc.c</code>:</p>
<pre>381 // Wait for a child process to exit and return its pid.<br>382 // Return -1 if this process has no children.<br>383 int<br>384 wait(uint64 addr)<br>385 {<br>386 &nbsp; struct proc *np;<br>387 &nbsp; int havekids, pid;<br>388 &nbsp; struct proc *p = myproc();<br>389<br>390 &nbsp; acquire(&amp;wait_lock);<br>391<br>392 &nbsp; for(;;){<br>393 &nbsp; &nbsp; // Scan through table looking for exited children.<br>394 &nbsp; &nbsp; havekids = 0;<br>395 &nbsp; &nbsp; for(np = proc; np &lt; &amp;proc[NPROC]; np++){<br>396 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if(np-&gt;parent == p){<br>397 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // make sure the child isn't still in exit() or swtch().<br>398 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; acquire(&amp;np-&gt;lock);<br>399<br>400 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; havekids = 1;<br>401 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if(np-&gt;state == ZOMBIE){<br>402 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Found one.<br>403 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pid = np-&gt;pid;<br>404 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if(addr != 0 &amp;&amp; copyout(p-&gt;pagetable, addr, (char *)&amp;np-&gt;xstate,<br>405 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sizeof(np-&gt;xstate)) &lt; 0) {<br>406 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; release(&amp;np-&gt;lock);<br>407 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; release(&amp;wait_lock);<br>408 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return -1;<br>409 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>410 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; freeproc(np);<br>411 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; release(&amp;np-&gt;lock);<br>412 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; release(&amp;wait_lock);<br>413 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return pid;<br>414 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>415 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; release(&amp;np-&gt;lock);<br>416 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>417 &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>418<br>419 &nbsp; &nbsp; // No point waiting if we don't have any children.<br>420 &nbsp; &nbsp; if(!havekids || p-&gt;killed){<br>421 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; release(&amp;wait_lock);<br>422 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return -1;<br>423 &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>424<br>425 &nbsp; &nbsp; // Wait for a child to exit.<br>426 &nbsp; &nbsp; sleep(p, &amp;wait_lock); &nbsp;//DOC: wait-sleep<br>427 &nbsp; }<br>428 }</pre>
<p>Don't panic. There's not a lot going on here. Here is the step-by-step analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>wait_lock</code> is acquired on line 390</li>
<li>An infinite spinloop is started. This loop will keep going as long as this process has at least one child, or has not been killed by another process (see lines 420-423)</li>
<li>Loop through all the processes (line 395) looking for a process that has the current process as a parent (line 396).</li>
<li>When a child process is found, acquire the child process lock (line 398) to check if it's a <code>ZOMBIE</code> process (line 401)
<ul>
<li>Remember, a process in the <code>ZOMBIE</code> state has terminated via the <code>exit</code> function and is waiting for the parent to clean up after it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a dead child is found, copy the exit state of the child into the integer variable reference (lines 404-405) used as a parameter for the <code>wait</code> system call made by the user-space program.
<ul>
<li>Computer science is great. Where else can we talk about a ""dead child"" without feeling existential remorse?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Free the child process process (line 410) and return the process ID of the child to the caller of <code>wait</code> (line 413)</li>
<li>If there are no children to this current process, or it has been killed by another process, exit the function (including the infinite loop) with an error value (lines 425-428))</li>
<li>If none of the above cause <code>wait</code> to return, then sleep - here's the spinlock tool we can use in the mutex code!</li>
</ul>
<p>This specific call to <code>sleep</code> on line 426 takes two parameters: the pointer to the current process structure and a reference to the <code>wait_lock</code>. Let's take a look at the function signature for <code>sleep</code> found in the <code>kernel/defs.h</code> header file:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;99 void &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sleep(void*, struct spinlock*);</pre>
<p>The second parameter makes sense, but what is the deal with the first parameter? It is type <code>void *</code>. This means that an address pointer to any data structure is allowed here. It can be a pointer to literally anything, an integer, a pointer to a float, a pointer to a <code>struct proc</code> (like how <code>sleep</code> is called in <code>wait</code>), anything. This pointer to ""anything"" is actually used as a unique reference value for the function that will cause <code>sleep</code> to ""wake up"" and return to the caller. Let's take a look at the function that causes the <code>wait</code> function to wake up - the <code>exit</code> function in the <code>kernel/proc.c</code> source file:</p>
<pre>336 // Exit the current process. &nbsp;Does not return.<br>337 // An exited process remains in the zombie state<br>338 // until its parent calls wait().<br>339 void<br>340 exit(int status)<br>341 {<br>342 &nbsp; struct proc *p = myproc();<br>343<br>344 &nbsp; if(p == initproc)<br>345 &nbsp; &nbsp; panic(""init exiting"");<br>346<br>347 &nbsp; // Close all open files.<br>348 &nbsp; for(int fd = 0; fd &lt; NOFILE; fd++){<br>349 &nbsp; &nbsp; if(p-&gt;ofile[fd]){<br>350 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; struct file *f = p-&gt;ofile[fd];<br>351 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fileclose(f);<br>352 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; p-&gt;ofile[fd] = 0;<br>353 &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>354 &nbsp; }<br>355<br>356 &nbsp; begin_op();<br>357 &nbsp; iput(p-&gt;cwd);<br>358 &nbsp; end_op();<br>359 &nbsp; p-&gt;cwd = 0;<br>360<br>361 &nbsp; acquire(&amp;wait_lock);<br>362<br>363 &nbsp; // Give any children to init.<br>364 &nbsp; reparent(p);<br>365<br>366 &nbsp; // Parent might be sleeping in wait().<br>367 &nbsp; wakeup(p-&gt;parent);<br>368<br>369 &nbsp; acquire(&amp;p-&gt;lock);<br>370<br>371 &nbsp; p-&gt;xstate = status;<br>372 &nbsp; p-&gt;state = ZOMBIE;<br>373<br>374 &nbsp; release(&amp;wait_lock);<br>375<br>376 &nbsp; // Jump into the scheduler, never to return.<br>377 &nbsp; sched();<br>378 &nbsp; panic(""zombie exit"");<br>379 }</pre>
<p>Let's walk through this function:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, make sure it's not the <code>init</code> process that's exiting (lines 344-345). If <code>init</code> exits, then our operating system no longer can operate.</li>
<li>Close all the open files for the process (lines 347-354).</li>
<li>Decrement the reference count to the current working directory (lines 356-359). More will be discussed about this in later modules.</li>
<li>Acquire the <code>wait_lock</code> (line 361). This is spinlock is held until the release on line 374</li>
<li>If this process has any children, reassign those children to the <code>init</code> process on line 364 (this is why <code>init</code> can never exit)</li>
<li>Call <code>wakeup</code> using the pointer to the parent process structure - this is what we're looking for!</li>
<li>Save the exit status (line 371), set the process to the <code>ZOMBIE</code> state (line 372), release <code>wait_lock</code> (line 374), and ""schedule"" the process (line 377)
<ul>
<li>This really doesn't cause the process to be scheduled to run on a CPU. Remember that only <code>RUNNABLE</code> processes are allow to be scheduled, and this process is no longer anything except a <code>ZOMBIE</code> process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice the parameter that is used for the <code>wakeup</code> call - the pointer to the parent process structure. This is the same pointer that is used by the <code>wait</code> function to go to sleep. <strong>This is critically important for you to understand the relationship between <code>sleep</code> and <code>wakeup</code></strong>. Every process that calls <code>sleep</code> stores the ""reference"" value in the first parameter so it may be looked up when another process calls <code>wakeup</code>. When a process is found to contain that ""reference"" value (xv6 calls it a ""channel""), that process is allowed to be rescheduled. You can see this in the <code>sleep</code> and <code>wakeup</code> function in <code>kernel/proc.c</code>:</p>
<pre>526 // Atomically release lock and sleep on chan.<br>527 // Reacquires lock when awakened.<br>528 void<br>529 sleep(void *chan, struct spinlock *lk)<br>530 {<br>531 &nbsp; struct proc *p = myproc();<br>532<br>533 &nbsp; // Must acquire p-&gt;lock in order to<br>534 &nbsp; // change p-&gt;state and then call sched.<br>535 &nbsp; // Once we hold p-&gt;lock, we can be<br>536 &nbsp; // guaranteed that we won't miss any wakeup<br>537 &nbsp; // (wakeup locks p-&gt;lock),<br>538 &nbsp; // so it's okay to release lk.<br>539<br>540 &nbsp; acquire(&amp;p-&gt;lock); &nbsp;//DOC: sleeplock1<br>541 &nbsp; release(lk);<br>542<br>543 &nbsp; // Go to sleep.<br>544 &nbsp; p-&gt;chan = chan;<br>545 &nbsp; p-&gt;state = SLEEPING;<br>546<br>547 &nbsp; sched();<br>548<br>549 &nbsp; // Tidy up.<br>550 &nbsp; p-&gt;chan = 0;<br>551<br>552 &nbsp; // Reacquire original lock.<br>553 &nbsp; release(&amp;p-&gt;lock);<br>554 &nbsp; acquire(lk);<br>555 }<br>556<br>557 // Wake up all processes sleeping on chan.<br>558 // Must be called without any p-&gt;lock.<br>559 void<br>560 wakeup(void *chan)<br>561 {<br>562 &nbsp; struct proc *p;<br>563<br>564 &nbsp; for(p = proc; p &lt; &amp;proc[NPROC]; p++) {<br>565 &nbsp; &nbsp; if(p != myproc()){<br>566 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; acquire(&amp;p-&gt;lock);<br>567 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if(p-&gt;state == SLEEPING &amp;&amp; p-&gt;chan == chan) {<br>568 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; p-&gt;state = RUNNABLE;<br>569 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>570 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; release(&amp;p-&gt;lock);<br>571 &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>572 &nbsp; }<br>573 }</pre>
<p>Notice that <code>sleep</code> releases the spinlock (line 541) before it sets the process to the <code>SLEEPING</code> state and ""schedules"" it. When another process sets the sleeping process back to <code>RUNNABLE</code> by calling <code>wakeup</code> (line 568), the process will return to re-acquire it's lock (line 554) before returning from <code>sleep</code>. This way, the spinlock can be acquired before calling sleep and we can expect the spinlock to still be locked when <code>sleep</code> returns.</p>
<h4><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Part 6</strong></span>: Using <code>sleep</code> and <code>wakeup</code> in the Mutex Code (~15-20 lines of code)</h4>
<ul>
<li>In this section you will:
<ul>
<li>Write the code to lock a mutex</li>
<li>Write the code to unlock a mutex</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Assume that the mutex state array is named <code>mutex_state_array</code> and the spinlock for the state array is named <code>mutex_state_array_lock</code> (I'm hoping my use of long variable names has encouraged you to shorten yours). The following needs to happen in the mutex <code>lock</code> code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the integer ID of the mutex passed in as a parameter to the system call (using <code>argint</code>)</li>
<li>Acquire the mutex spinlock by calling <code>acquire(&amp;mutex_state_array_lock);</code></li>
<li>Loop as long as the indexed mutex is set to a locked state. This will be checking if <code>mutex_state_array[index] == MUTEX_IS_LOCKED</code></li>
<li>Inside the loop, sleep using a reference to the specific element in the <code>mutex_state_array</code> and the spinlock that has been acquired. It will looks something like this: <code>sleep(&amp;mutex_state_array[index], &amp;mutex_state_array_lock);</code></li>
<li>Outside the loop set the mutex state to locked</li>
<li>Release the mutex spinlock by calling <code>release(&amp;mutex_state_array_lock);</code></li>
<li>Return from the system call with a success code</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing missing here is validating the index value passed into the system call. This validation should happen after the index is retrieved with the <code>argint</code> call but before the mutex spinlock is acquired. You should check that the integer is within the bounds of the mutex state array, or between 0 and <code>NMUTEX</code>.</p>
<p>Always validate the parameters coming into a system call. When writing kernel code <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>never trust parameters coming from user space</strong></span>. Ever. Seriously.</p>
<p>Now consider the code for the <code>unlock</code> system call:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the integer ID of the mutex passed in as a parameter to the system call (again, using <code>argint</code>. Don't forget to validate the index)</li>
<li>Acquire the mutex spinlock (same as the <code>lock</code>)</li>
<li>Set the mutex state to unlocked</li>
<li>Release the mutex spinlock (same as the <code>lock</code>)</li>
<li>Call <code>wakeup</code> with the same reference used when the call to <code>sleep</code> was made. It's the first parameter of sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might wonder if it's appropriate to release the spinlock before calling <code>wakeup</code>. This is actually so the freshly-awakened process does not suddenly have to wait for the spinlock just when it was getting started. If the <code>wakeup</code> call was made before <code>release</code>, there's a chance the scheduler will interrupt in between the two calls and allow the other process to start. This would cause the other process to reach the spinlock acquire and have to wait for the interrupted process to be rescheduled to release the spinlock. Simple efficiency.</p>
<h4><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Part 7</strong></span>: Finishing up with the Initialize Mutex System Call (~10 lines of code)</h4>
<ul>
<li>In this section you will:
<ul>
<li>Write the mutex initialization function</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The initialize system call is very simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquire the mutex spinlock</li>
<li>Loop through each element from 0 to <code>NMUTEX</code> in the mutex state array looking for an unallocated mutex</li>
<li>If one cannot be found, release the spinlock and return an error condition</li>
<li>If one is found, set the mutex state to unlocked</li>
<li>Release the spinlock and return the index into the mutex state array
<ul>
<li>This index is the ""mutex handle"" that the process will use to call <code>lock</code> and <code>unlock</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Part 8</strong></span>: Run the <code>assn6</code>&nbsp;test program</h4>
<p>Now you can test your mutex code by executing the <code>assn6</code>&nbsp;program in xv6.</p>
<pre>xv6 kernel is booting<br><br>hart 1 starting<br>hart 2 starting<br>init: starting sh<br>$ <strong>assn6</strong><br>assn6 Shared Memory Test Program by John Jolly<br>Total after loops: 0<br>Success! Increments match decrements!</pre>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Warning</strong></span>: When you use your working mutex locks, the code will slow down significantly. My test program runs nearly ten minutes before showing a working result. My suggestion to you is to change the <code>MAX_LOOP</code> macro at the top (line 4) of the source file at <code>user/assn6.c</code> to something less that 1000000 to verify everything is working. Try 100. If that works, go back up to 1000000 and wait to see if you are successful. Expect it to be slow.</p>
<h3>Extra Credit:</h3>
<p>There are several chances for extra credit in this assignment. Here are the extra credit options available:</p>
<ul>
<li>+10% - Speed up the <code>assn6</code>&nbsp;program by implementing course-grained locking (~10 lines of code)</li>
<li>+10% - Implement and use a system call to deallocate a mutex (~20 lines of code)</li>
<li>+20% - Implement a global mutex scheduling wait queue for process blocked on locked mutexes (~50 lines of code)</li>
<li>+20% - Implement per-mutex wait queues in the kernel and write code in the <code>assn6</code>&nbsp;program that use five locks concurrently (~100 lines of code)</li>
<li>+20% - Implement in-kernel semaphores and change your <code>assn6</code> test program to implement the producer-consumer model</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hints:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Build your stub system calls first and make sure everything compiles. No reason to fight compiler bugs and deadlock bugs at the same time.</li>
<li>Keep your critical sections small. If you need to wrap an entire function in a critical section, fine. You should seek to reduce it if possible, though.</li>
<li>You should <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>really</strong></span> understand what the first parameter of the <code>sleep</code> and <code>wakeup</code> function represents. Why is it a <code>void *</code>? What are potential uses for that parameter?</li>
<li>You can use the <code>printf</code> function in the kernel code for debugging. Don't hesitate to print out the current state of a mutex for debugging purposes. Or print the value that <code>argint</code> puts into your variable.</li>
<li>Reduce your problem set for debugging. Modify the test program to reduce the number of loops. Reduce the number of total mutexes in the system. Smaller footprints are always easier to debug.</li>
<li>If you're frustrated with your changes not working, check in your changes and start over. Checkout your original <code>assn5</code> branch, create a new branch, and try again with your new knowledge from the previous branch.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style=""color: inherit; line-height: 40px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.5em;"">Submission:</span></h4>
<p>When you're satisfied with your mutex system call and accompanying test program, stage the changes and commit them to your local git repository. Here is your pre-push checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you view <code>git log</code>, does it show <code>HEAD -&gt; assn6</code>? If not, check out an assn6 branch with <code>git checkout -b assn6 student/assn5</code> where <code>student</code> is the name for your remote repository</li>
<li>Do you see any uncommitted files in <code>git status</code>? Then stage them and commit them now</li>
<li>Your git status is clean? Try your assignment one last time by starting the xv6 OS and running your test program</li>
<li>Your <code>assn6</code> test program runs great? Excellent, you're ready to push your <code>assn6</code> branch to your remote repository!</li>
<li>Go to Canvas and submit your assignment with a note that you've pushed <code>assn6</code> to Bitbucket. Note in your Canvas submission any extra credit you completed.</li>
</ul>

570909,6965306,Assignment 7 - Add and Use the Execute Permission,"<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118710790/canvas_global_app.css""><h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The xv6 operating system lacks any form of file permissions such as read, write, or execute. For this assignment you will add the execute permission to the xv6 file system and check this permission when executing a program. You will make the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a test program named <code>assn7</code> that will check the execute permission bit on files and attempt to execute files with and without the bit set</li>
<li>Add the permission value to the on-disk inode, in-memory inode, and the stat structure</li>
<li>Change the <code>mkfs</code> utility to create the xv6 filesystem with the appropriate permissions per file</li>
<li>Properly initialize and handle the permission value in the kernel</li>
<li>Properly set directory permissions when created</li>
<li>Check the correct setting of the permission when the <code>exec</code> system call is made</li>
</ul>
<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Creating your test program</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>In this part you will create the <code>assn7</code> test program and add it to the Makefile</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Create a new branch from the <code>riscv</code> branch named <code>assn7</code>. Create the source code for your test program in a file named <code>user/assn7.c</code>. Make sure to add <code>assn7</code> to the Makefile. Your <code>assn7</code> test program should do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open <code>README</code> and using <code>stat</code> check that the execute permission is not set</li>
<li>Open <code>assn7</code> and using <code>stat</code> check that the execute permission is set</li>
<li>Create a child process and attempt to <code>exec</code> the <code>README</code> file. Report the wrong <code>exec</code> exit status</li>
<li>Create a child process and attempt to <code>exec</code> the <code>echo</code> command with an empty string. Report the wrong <code>exec</code> exit status</li>
<li>Show success when all tests pass</li>
</ul>
<p>You can obtain information about a file using the <code>stat</code> library call. This function takes two parameters: a path to the file and a reference to a variable of type <code>struct stat</code>. Here is an example on how to call the library function (your test program will use it slightly differently):</p>
<pre>struct stat st;<br>int ret;<br><br>ret = stat(""README"", &amp;st);<br>if(ret &lt; 0) {<br>  printf(""stat for README returned an error: %d\n"", ret);<br>  exit(1);<br>}<br>printf(""The inode number of the file is %d\n"", st.ino);</pre>
<p>There are currently several values available in <code>struct stat</code> including:</p>
<pre>struct stat {<br>&nbsp; int dev; &nbsp; &nbsp; // File system's disk device<br>&nbsp; uint ino; &nbsp; &nbsp;// Inode number<br>&nbsp; short type; &nbsp;// Type of file<br>  short nlink; // Number of links to file<br>&nbsp; uint64 size; // Size of file in bytes<br>};</pre>
<p>For this assignment you will be adding a new value to <code>struct stat</code> called <code>perm</code>. Just like <code>type</code> and <code>nlink</code> it should be type <code>short</code>. Your test program will check this <code>perm</code> variable two times: once when you check <code>stat</code> for the file <code>README</code> and a second time when you check <code>stat</code> for the file <code>assn7</code>. The <code>README</code> file is a simple text file and should not be set to executable, whereas your test program should be set as an executable file.</p>
<p>After checking the executable permission on the files using <code>stat</code> you will then attempt to execute each file using the <code>exec</code> system call. Here is an example on how to execute a program such as <code>ls README assn7</code> (your program will use the system call slightly differently):</p>
<pre>int pid;<br>int ret;<br><br>pid = fork();<br>if(pid == 0) { // Child process<br>  char *newargv[] = {<br>    ""ls"",<br>    ""README"",<br>    ""assn7"",<br>    0 };<br>  ret = exec(newargv[0], newargv);<br>  exit(ret);<br>}<br>wait(&amp;ret);<br>printf(""Executing 'ls' gave a exit code of %d\n"", ret);</pre>
<p>The <code>exec</code> system call takes two parameters: A string for the path to the program to execute and an array of strings for the parameters. The array is the tricky bit, as there are two requirements. First, the array must contain the name of the program as the first array element. Second, the array must contain a zero (0) as the last array element. The <code>exec</code> system call returns only if an error occurs, otherwise the child process is exclusively given over to the loaded program.</p>
<p>Your test program needs to check if an error occurred when attempting to run a program. Currently <code>exec</code> in xv6 only reports one error: <code>-1</code>. This is the same error when you try to load a program that does not exist, as well as the error if the program file is corrupted. Your assignment needs to detect an error specifically when the permissions are wrong. For this assignment the error reported by <code>exec</code> when the permissions are wrong will be <code>-2</code>. Your test program should check for this specific error value from <code>exec</code>.</p>
<p>Notice that if <code>exec</code> returns an error, it is good practice to exit the child process with an error value as well. Exiting the child process with the error code returned by <code>exec</code> is fine for our purposes.</p>
<h3>Part 2: Adding the <code>perm</code> variable to <code>struct stat</code>, <code>struct inode</code>, and <code>struct dinode</code> (6 lines of code)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>In this part you will add the <code>perm</code> variable to three structures, and a <code>filler</code> variable to the on-disk inode structure</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are three structures you need to add the new permission variable:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>struct stat</code>: This is how file metadata gets from the kernel to the user program.
<ul>
<li>Only the information the user program needs is provided by <code>struct stat</code>.
<ul>
<li>This does not include things such as the block pointers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can find this structure in the file <code>kernel/stat.h</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>struct inode</code>: This is the in-memory structure where file metadata resides.
<ul>
<li>This resembles the on-disk inode structure with a few extra details such as a reference count.</li>
<li>You can find this structure in the file <code>kernel/file.h</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>struct dinode</code>: This is the on-disk structure where file metadata is stored
<ul>
<li>This structure is loaded into the <code>struct inode</code> when the file is opened</li>
<li>This structure has a very important limitation. It&nbsp;<strong>must be</strong> a size that evenly divides the xv6 storage blocksize of 1024</li>
<li>You can find this structure in the file <code>kernel/fs.h</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's start with the <code>struct dinode</code> size requirement. Currently the structure looks like this:</p>
<pre>// On-disk inode structure<br>struct dinode {<br>&nbsp; short type; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // File type<br>  short major; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// Major device number (T_DEVICE only)<br>&nbsp; short minor; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// Minor device number (T_DEVICE only)<br>&nbsp; short nlink; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// Number of links to inode in file system<br>  uint size; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// Size of file (bytes)<br>&nbsp; uint addrs[NDIRECT+1]; &nbsp; // Data block addresses<br>};</pre>
<p>If you add up the size of each element, you get a total structure size of:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>short type</code>: 2 bytes</li>
<li><code>short major</code>: 2 bytes</li>
<li><code>short minor</code>: 2 bytes</li>
<li><code>short nlink</code>: 2 bytes</li>
<li><code>uint size</code>: 4 bytes</li>
<li><code>uint addrs[NDIRECT+1]</code>: The value of <code>NDIRECT</code> is 12, so this array declaration is 4 * 13 = 52 bytes</li>
<li>Total: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 52 = 64</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows for 1024 / 64 = 16 on-disk inodes per block. This even division is necessary for a kernel memory allocation scheme called the SLAB allocation. One page of memory or one block of disk is allocated for a number of similar structures. In order to maintain this even division requirement, any changes to the inode structure must allow the structure to evenly divide the block size of 1024.</p>
<p>If you add a <code>short perm</code> variable to this structure, it will increase the structure size from 64 bytes to 66 bytes, which does not evenly divide the block size. In order to fix this the structure needs to have a variable removed (perhaps decrease <code>NDIRECT</code> by one) or one or more variables need to be added to bring the structure up to the next evenly divisible size (in our case, 128 bytes).</p>
<p>You will add the <code>short perm</code> variable to the structure, but you will also add a filler variable <code>char filler[62]</code>. Now the structure will be 64 bytes of the original data, 2 bytes for the new <code>perm</code> variable, and 62 bytes for the new <code>filler</code> variable, making a total of 128 bytes. This will only allow 8 on-disk inodes per block, but xv6 will allocate more on-disk blocks as necessary, so it shouldn't be a problem.</p>
<p>As there are no size restrictions on the <code>struct inode</code> and <code>struct stat</code> data structures, just add a <code>short perm</code> variable to each structure.</p>
<p>Also, add two lines to <code>kernel/stat.h</code> (be careful not to put a semicolon after each line):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#define FPERM_NOX 0</code>: This sets the permission of the file or directory to ""not executable""</li>
<li><code>#define FPERM_EXE 1</code>: This sets the permission of the file or directory to ""is executable""</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part 3: Adding the <code>perm</code> value to the filesystem through <code>mkfs</code> (8 lines of code)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>In this part you will change the <code>mkfs/mkfs.c</code> source to create file and directory inodes with the correct permission (execute permission for directories and program files with filenames starting with an underscore)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you run the command <code>make qemu</code> you are actually creating two things. First, the kernel is compiled and linked into a file name <code>kernel/kernel</code>. Next, the user-space programs are compiled and linked and combined into the file system image named <code>fs.img</code>. This image is created using the <code>mkfs/mkfs</code> program which is also compiled as part of the build process. In order to have the execute permission set for the executable programs, you must modify the <code>mkfs/mkfs.c</code> source code to set this permission for each executable.</p>
<p>A problem that you will need to work around is that the <code>mkfs/mkfs.c</code> file is marked to be ignored by git commands. This may have been by accident or by design, but for your purposes you will need to circumvent this. There are two ways to do this, and it is up to you which method you use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stage your changes using the command <code>git add -f mkfs/mkfs.c</code>: The <code>-f</code> option will cause git to ignore the <code>.gitignore</code> file for this one command. You will see this suggestion if you try to add your changes without the option. This is probably the least invasive option</li>
<li>Change <code>mkfs</code> to <code>mkfs/mkfs</code> in the <code>.gitignore</code> file: Instead of ignoring the whole directory, this change will ignore a specific file in the directory. Specifically the compiled binary <code>mkfs</code> that is created during the build process will be ignored, but not the source code itself. If you make this change, you will want to stage and commit <code>.gitignore</code> along with your changes to <code>mkfs/mkfs.c</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>mkfs/mkfs.c</code> source has a function called <code>ialloc</code>. It's purpose is to properly set the values within the on-disk inode structure then write that on-disk inode structure onto the actual storage media. Currently it takes one parameters, <code>ushort type</code>. This value will be added to the on-disk inode structure and identifies if the inode is a file or a directory. You will add a second parameter called <code>ushort perm</code> and copy that value into the <code>din.perm</code> structure variable. Make sure you use the <code>xshort()</code> function the same way used by the <code>type</code> parameter.</p>
<p>You will also need to change the forward declaration for the <code>ialloc</code> function near the top of the <code>mkfs/mkfs.c</code> source file. Remember, the function declaration is at the top, the function definition is much further into the file.</p>
<p>There are two places in the <code>mkfs/mkfs.c</code> file where the <code>ialloc</code> function is called:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating the root directory inode: You will find a call to <code>ialloc(T_DIR)</code>. You need to set the directory to ""executable"" as you want the user program to be able to make this directory the current working directory. Change the function call to <code>ialloc(T_DIR, FPERM_EXE)</code></li>
<li>Creating the files: You will find a call to <code>ialloc(T_FILE)</code>. You want to change this call, but you don't want to set every file as executable, only the files with filenames that start with an underscore (_).
<ul>
<li>Just above this function call you'll see an <code>if(shortname[0] == '_')</code> condition. This would be a good place to set the <code>FPERM_EXE</code> permission. Otherwise, for files with filenames that do not start with an underscore you should set the <code>FPERM_NOX</code> permission</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part 4: Handle the <code>perm</code> structure variable in <code>kernel/fs.c</code> (4 lines of code)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>In this part you will add four lines initializing or copying the permission value into the correct structure variable</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Most inode operations in the kernel happen within the <code>kernel/fs.c</code> file. There are four changes that need to be made to this file:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>ialloc</code> function: Initialize the <code>dip-&gt;perm</code> variable to <code>FPERM_NOX</code><br>
<ul>
<li>This is the default inode setting and should only be changed as necessary, such as for creating directories in part 5</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>iupdate</code> function: Copy the <code>ip-&gt;perm</code> value into the <code>dip-&gt;perm</code> variable</li>
<li>The <code>ilock</code> function: Copy the <code>dip-&gt;perm</code> value into&nbsp; the <code>ip-&gt;perm</code> variable</li>
<li>The <code>stati</code> function: Copy the <code>ip-&gt;perm</code> value into the <code>st-&gt;perm</code> variable</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part 5: Fix the <code>create</code> system call helper function to set the correct directory permission (2 lines of code)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>In this part you will set the <code>FPERM_EXE</code> permission for directories created by the <code>create</code> function in <code>kernel/sysfile.c</code></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Inside the kernel there is only one location where a new inode is created. This is in the <code>create</code> function found in <code>kernel/sysfile.c</code>. This function is called when a new file, directory, or device node is created, so it is central to creating a new inode. The <code>ialloc</code> function initializes the <code>perm</code> variable in the inode to <code>FPERM_NOX</code> by default, but you want to change this for new directories. Any time an inode needs to be changed, three functions must be called:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ilock</code>: This function is exactly what you think. It provides a mutually exclusive lock for the changes made to the inode. This should make sense when you consider concurrent inode access in the kernel
<ul>
<li>Make sure any change you make to the inode (such as set the <code>FPERM_EXE</code> permission on directories) happens after the call to <code>ilock</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>iupdate</code>: This function prepares the inode changes to be written to the on-disk inode.
<ul>
<li>This may not happen immediately as xv6 caches block writes, but as far as you're concerned, you've made the change permanent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>iunlockput</code>: This function releases the mutual exclusion to the inode lock and releases it's reference to the inode</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice the <code>if</code> statement that checks if the type of the file created is <code>T_DIR</code>. This would be a good place to change the directory permission to <code>FPERM_EXE</code>. Remember to change the permission value for the <code>ip</code> structure. Do not change it for the <code>dp</code> structure as this represents the inode for the parent directory, and you should assume the parent directory was created with the proper permissions.</p>
<p>Make sure you call <code>iupdate(ip)</code> after changing the permission of the inode.</p>
<h3>Part 6: Change <code>exec</code> to report an error if the program file does not have the <code>FPERM_EXE</code> permission (10 lines of code)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>In this part you will create a function that will check the execution flag of an inode, and return a unique error value of <code>-2</code> when the program inode is not executable</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>exec</code> function can be found in the file <code>kernel/exec.c</code>. This function does all the work of loading a program file into memory, and setting up the process structure and memory for the new program. It is in the <code>exec</code> function that the inode for the program file is opened. This happens when the <code>namei</code> function is called. You want to check the inode permissions for <code>FPERM_EXE</code> just after the inode is locked.</p>
<p>But the <code>kernel/exec.c</code> file doesn't know anything about the content of the <code>struct inode</code>.</p>
<p>You will create a helper function in <code>kernel/fs.c</code> that will take a <code>struct inode*</code> as a parameter and return <code>1</code> if the inode permission is set to <code>FPERM_EXE</code>, or <code>0</code> if the inode permission is not set to <code>FPERM_EXE</code>. I suggest sticking with the naming conventions used in <code>kernel/fs.c</code> and name the function <code>is_execi</code>. Make sure you add your new function declaration to <code>kernel/defs.h</code></p>
<p>Now in the <code>exec</code> function of <code>kernel/exec.c</code>, call your new <code>is_execi</code> function to test if the inode is executable. If it is not executable then <code>goto bad</code>.</p>
<p>One problem with the <code>exec</code> function is it returns an error value <code>-1</code> for all the events that can go wrong. This includes not finding the program file, corrupted program file data, memory allocation for the program or data, even the copying of the arguments to the new program stack. This is unusable to our test program as you will need to know specifically when a program cannot be executed. This means an error value other than <code>-1</code>. To do this you need to make three changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new integer variable named <code>err</code> that is initialized to the error <code>-1</code></li>
<li>Return the value in the <code>err</code> variable after the <code>bad</code> label at the bottom of the <code>exec</code> function
<ul>
<li>It's currently <code>return -1;</code>, just replace <code>-1</code> with <code>err</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set <code>err</code> to <code>-2</code> if the inode does not have the <code>FPERM_EXE</code> permission set, before going to <code>bad</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>You have added a new permission value to an inode structure, and are using it to verify that a program can be executed. You should make sure everything builds and your test program does what you expect it to before pushing your final changes. You should make sure your work area is clean and pushed to your student repository under the <code>assn7</code> branch. Go to Canvas and submit a message indicating your assignment is complete and ready to be graded.</p>
<h3>Extra credit:</h3>
<p>There are many things that can be done with the new file permission, here are a few suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 points (2 lines of code): Add to the <code>user/ls.c</code> program to indicate when a file is executable (X) or not executable (_)</li>
<li>5 points (20 lines of code): Create a <code>stat</code> user program that reports all the stats of a file, including file permissions</li>
<li>10 points (40 lines of code): Create a <code>chmod</code> system call that allows changing a files permission, and a test program demonstrating the system call</li>
</ul>

<p>For this assignment you will use four text data files named <i>parts.txt</i>, <i>projects.txt</i>, <i>spj.txt</i>, and <i>suppliers.txt</i> (linked at the bottom of this page). These files contain comma-separated data for four database tables: <strong>parts</strong>, <strong>projects</strong>, <strong>spj</strong>, and <strong>suppliers</strong>. The “data dictionary” (slot descriptions) for this database is: <br>• <strong>suppliers</strong>: (sno,sname,status,city) <br>• <strong>parts</strong>: (pno,pname,color,weight,city) <br>• <strong>projects</strong>: (jno,jname,city) <br>• <strong>spj</strong>: (sno,pno,jno,qty)</p>
<p>The first slot in each tuple (<strong>sno</strong>, <strong>pno</strong>, and <strong>jno</strong>) in the first 3 tables is the unique record id (a string). You may let all of your slot data types be strings for simplicity in this assignment.</p>
<p>Each text file has the name of the relation/table and the slot/column names on the first two lines, respectively. Use these to properly define your named tuples.</p>
<p>For this project, read the data from each file into an associated set of <strong>namedtuples</strong>, so you can process the queries below using <strong>set and dictionary comprehensions</strong> (a dictionary comprehension for query number six).</p>
<h3>Data files</h3>
<p>You can download the data files individually or download the zip file which has all four .txt data files inside it. <br>◆ <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""suppliers.txt"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/571103/files/117628702?verifier=9H1M7BqZysNp3ihOWQy5MaTpxdb1cxoCQiBL0seA&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/571103/files/117628702"" data-api-returntype=""File"">suppliers.txt </a><br>◆ <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""parts.txt"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/571103/files/117628704?verifier=Po3Zqg23AXUkwpDU1wNciIZW1SXqZghCBhjNEHDy&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/571103/files/117628704"" data-api-returntype=""File"">parts.txt</a> <br>◆ <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""projects.txt"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/571103/files/117628701?verifier=F8VgYFefC6Bles9JI8peLPkkCxF1cIjGg0qiBhb1&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/571103/files/117628701"" data-api-returntype=""File"">projects.txt</a> <br>◆ <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""spj.txt"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/571103/files/117628705?verifier=eP98GMint0UljQwKh6TphCHi6EbfGmp2CxDqEMEu&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/571103/files/117628705"" data-api-returntype=""File"">spj.txt</a> <br><br>◆ <a class=""instructure_file_link inline_disabled"" title=""compData.zip"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/571103/files/117628703?verifier=1A3FzeqHLX4ZxPrLq59fv513AgI94FscS1Nzr5FG&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/571103/files/117628703"" data-api-returntype=""File"">compData.zip</a></p>
<h3>Queries</h3>
<p>Process these queries using comprehensions:<br>1. Get names of all suppliers that supply bolts. <br>2. Get names of all suppliers that supply blue parts. <br>3. Get names of all suppliers not used in Athens projects <br>4. Get names and colors of all parts not used in Oslo <br>5. Get pairs of names of all suppliers that are located in the same city. <br>6. Print all suppliers out by city</p>
<h3>Processing queries with comprehensions</h3>
<p>To illustrate, you can find suppliers for projects in London as shown below in the file <i>london_named.py</i> in the Code folder:</p>
<pre>{s.sname for s in suppliers for r in spj for j in projects 
 if r.sno == s.sno if j.jno == r.jno if j.city == 'London'}
</pre>
<p>which gives the response:</p>
<pre>{'Jones', 'Adams', 'Clark'}
</pre>
<p>We use sets so that any duplicate tuples are removed, as is typical in database queries. For readability, you could separate the queries into multiple steps, as found in <i>london_named.py</i>, shown below:</p>
<pre>london_projs = {j.jno for j in projects if j.city == 'London'}
london_supp_ids = {r.sno for r in spj if r.jno in london_projs}
london_supps = {s.sname for s in suppliers if s.sno in london_supp_ids}
print(london_supps)
</pre>
<p>You can decide which form looks best to you for each problem individually.</p>
<p>Each text file has the name of the relation/table and the slot/column names on the first two lines, respectively. Use these to properly define your named tuples. To illustrate, here is <i>parts.txt</i>:</p>
<pre>parts
pno,pname,color,weight,city
p1,Nut,Red,12,London
p2,Bolt,Green,17,Paris
p3,Screw,Blue,17,Rome
p4,Screw,Red,14,London
p5,Cam,Blue,12,Paris
p6,Cog,Red,19,London 
</pre>
<p>The code that reads such data should be application independent/generic. I would write a function that returns the named tuple object. (<i>Hint</i>: Consider using the unary * sequence-flattening operator for arguments in a function call.)</p>
<p><i>Print no duplicates.</i> There should be <i>no top-level</i> loops in this script (they are inside the comprehensions) except for when you read the data in. <strong>The queries should use comprehensions only</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is the expected output (order within a set or dictionary is immaterial, for this project, and also within the pairs of suppliers in the same city):</p>
<pre>{'Adams'}
{'Jones', 'Adams', 'Blake'}
{'Blake'}
{('Cam', 'Blue'), ('Cog', 'Red'), ('Nut', 'Red'), ('Bolt', 'Green'), ('Screw', 'Red')}
{('Jones', 'Blake'), ('Smith', 'Clark')}
{'Paris': {'Jones', 'Blake'}, 'Athens': {'Adams'}, 'London': {'Clark', 'Smith'}}

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<div>Refer to the <strong>trace</strong> decorator from Professor Allison's Chapter 9 slide set. It counts the number of times a decorated function is executed. Modify <strong>trace</strong> (and rename it as <strong>track</strong>) so that it 1) caches the result of all function calls, so that the decorated function is never called twice with the same arguments, and 2) counts the total number of function calls. Tracking the count of calls is accomplished by using a <em>function attribute</em>. To illustrate how this works, consider the recursive function that computes the nth Fibonacci number.</div>
<pre>def fib(n):
    return n if n in (0,1) else fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
</pre>
<div>This implementation makes many repeated function calls on the same argument. If we decorate it as follows:</div>
<pre>@track
def fib(n):
    return n if n in (0,1) else fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
</pre>
<div>then calling <strong>print(fib(10), 'count =' ,fib.count)</strong> yields the following:</div>
<pre>55, calls = 177
</pre>
<div>Very wasteful! Your modified track decorator should print the following:</div>
<pre>(1,){} found in cache
(2,){} found in cache
(3,){} found in cache
(4,){} found in cache
(5,){} found in cache
(6,){} found in cache
(7,){} found in cache
(8,){} found in cache
</pre>
<div>The eight trace statements are printed whenever a repeated call is attempted on the arguments shown. Note that both positional and keyword arguments function as the cache dictionary key. This is done with the following statement:</div>
<pre>key = str(args) + str(kwargs)
</pre>
<p>using the customary parameter names for decorators.</p>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<div>Write a separate <strong>logging decorator</strong> that saves all function calls and their results in the file ""log.txt"". This requires opening the file for appending:</div>
<pre>logfile = open('log.txt','a')
</pre>
<div>You will need the wrapper function to open the file for each function call, write the information, and close the file.</div>
<div>When you decorate <strong>fib</strong> with only the <strong>log</strong> decorator, <em>log.txt</em> should contain the output below:</div>
<pre>@log
def fib(n):
 return n if n in (0,1) else fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
print(fib(10))   # Prints 55
</pre>
<p>The file <em>log.txt</em> contains:</p>

There are 3 input files to process: <br>• <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""customers.txt"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/571103/files/117628709?verifier=N7tRY62gzu3Ed9k4vKPqo8CShC5zh7s1wiwLwr8r&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/571103/files/117628709"" data-api-returntype=""File""><em>customers.txt</em></a><br>•<a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""items.txt"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/571103/files/117628707?verifier=A0g3NVnmn9tAoJgWtVSoS9AyMS3dqbVcKrCwiQ8X&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/571103/files/117628707"" data-api-returntype=""File""> <em>items.txt</em></a><br>• <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""orders.txt"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/571103/files/117628710?verifier=immND8S9AaJkDlN0hlPsHlW7VWhO1XXFqHfn749q&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/571103/files/117628710"" data-api-returntype=""File""><em>orders.txt</em></a></p>
<p>The first file holds customer data in a single text line like the following:</p>
<pre>810003,Kai Antonikov,31 Prairie Rose Street,Philadelphia,PA,19196,215-975-7421,kantonikov0@4shared.com
</pre>
<p>The data fields are the customer id, name, street, city, state, zip, phone, and email.</p>
<p>The file <em>items.txt</em> has fields item_id, description, and price:</p>
<pre>57464,Almonds Ground Blanched,2.99
</pre>
<p><em>Orders.txt</em> holds <strong>2 lines per order</strong>. The first line contains the customer id, order number, order date, and then a variable-length sequence of item_id–quantity pairs:</p>
<p>762212,1,2020-03-15,10951-3,64612-2,57544-1,80145-1,27515-2,16736-1,79758-2,29286-2,51822-3,39096-1,32641-3, …</p>
<p>In the line above, 3 items of product #10951 were ordered, 2 of product #64612, etc. Note that all fields in all files are comma-separated, and that the item_id–quantity pairs in <em>orders.txt</em> are separated by a dash.</p>
<p>The second line contains payment information in the form of payment code, and payment information. There are 3 types of payments:</p>
<p>• 1 = Credit card (card number and expiration date) <br>• 2 = PayPal (paypal_id only) <br>• 3 = Wire transfer (bank_id and account_id)</p>
<p>Here are respective examples:</p>

<p>The following UML class diagram suggests a design for this project.</p>

<p>Note that <strong>Payment</strong> should be an abstract class with abstract method <strong>__str__</strong>, which its derived classes must override to return a string which becomes part of printing an order, as illustrated in the sample output below. <strong>Order.print_order</strong> implicitly uses <strong>Customer.__str__</strong> and <strong>Payment.__str__</strong> to do its work.</p>
<p>Here is the main logic:</p>
<pre>if __name__ == '__main__':
    Customer.read_customers(""customers.txt"")
    Item.read_items(""items.txt"")
    Order.read_orders(""orders.txt"")
    
    # Now print orders to the file order_report.txt:
    …
</pre>
<p>The static methods <strong>Customer.read_customers</strong> and <strong>Item.read_items</strong> create respectively global dictionaries of <strong>Customer</strong> and <strong>Item</strong> objects obtained from file input. <strong>Order.read</strong>_orders populates a global list or dictionary with <strong>Order</strong> objects obtained from file input.</p>
<p>Your output should be in a file named <em>order_report.txt</em> that looks like the following:</p>

</pre>
<p>Each order begins with a dashed line and has 3 parts, each followed by an empty line. The orders appear in the order they are read from the file (they are already in date order), but <strong>the items in each order are sorted by item_id</strong>.</p>
<p>Name your (main) Python file <strong>groceries.py</strong>. Submit your <strong>groceries.py</strong> and <strong>order_report.txt</strong> files in Canvas by the due date.</p>
<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
<p>• Use <strong><span style=""font-family: 'courier new', courier;"">@dataclass</span></strong> for <strong>Customer</strong>, <strong>Item</strong>, <strong>LineItem</strong>, and <strong>Order</strong>. <br>• Customers and Item objects are found as needed by their respective IDs; don’t duplicate data. <br>• Make <strong>Order.total</strong> a read <em>property</em>; it returns <strong>payment.amount</strong>. Set the payment amount in <strong>read_orders</strong>. <br>• Note the formatting of the report, including 2 decimals for the order total. Match this output format exactly. <br>• You may have seen this project in CS 2370. The Python version is over 100 lines shorter. Make your solution Pythonic. Don’t just “translate” your C++ code.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,100.0,['online_upload']

You will use it for this assignment as a lexicon of English words.</p>
<p>Write a Python program that chooses a word of a specified length at random from the lexicon and displays it to the user in a random, scrambled order. Then let the user guess words of varying lengths that can be formed using the letters of the word and the same number of occurrences or less as they appear in the word. After every guess, respond to the user whether the guess was correct, and add it to the list of words that have been guessed so far. Print results grouped by length of words and alphabetized within each group.</p>
<p>Here is a sample execution:</p>
<pre>$ python3 wordgame.py
Enter the range of word lengths (low,high):<strong>3,6</strong>
renbur:

['---', '---', '---', '---', '---', '---', '---', '---', '---']
['----', '----', '----', '----']
['-----']
['------']

Enter a guess: <strong>bur</strong>
Correct!

urnrbe:

['---', '---', 'bur', '---', '---', '---', '---', '---', '---']
['----', '----', '----', '----']
['-----']
['------']

Enter a guess: <strong>burr</strong>
Correct!

['---', '---', 'bur', '---', '---', '---', '---', '---', '---']
['----', 'burr', '----', '----']
['-----']

Correct!

rebnur:

['---', '---', 'bur', '---', '---', '---', '---', 'run', '---']
['----', 'burr', '----', '----']
['-----']
['------']

Enter a guess: <strong>rune</strong>
Correct!

brurne:

['---', '---', 'bur', '---', '---', '---', '---', 'run', '---']
['----', 'burr', '----', 'rune']

Enter a guess: <strong>foo</strong>
Sorry. Try again

renrub:

['---', '---', 'bur', '---', '---', '---', '---', 'run', '---']
['----', 'burr', '----', 'rune']
['-----']
['------']

Enter a guess: <strong>burner</strong>
Correct!

nrrebu:

['---', '---', 'bur', '---', '---', '---', '---', 'run', '---']
['----', 'burr', '----', 'rune']
['-----']
['burner']

Enter a guess: <strong>burn</strong>
Correct!

enurrb:

['---', '---', 'bur', '---', '---', '---', '---', 'run', '---']
['burn', 'burr', '----', 'rune']
['-----']
['burner']

Enter a guess: <strong>urn</strong>
Correct!

nebrur:

['---', '---', 'bur', '---', '---', '---', '---', 'run', 'urn']
['burn', 'burr', '----', 'rune']

['burner']

Enter a guess: <strong>q</strong>

['brr', 'bun', 'bur', 'err', 'nub', 'rub', 'rue', 'run', 'urn', 'burn', 'burr', 'rube', 'rune', 'rerun', 'burner']
</pre>
<p>Note that you first prompt the user for the range of word lengths to consider. The largest length requested (6 in this case) determines the length of the word that you will choose randomly from the lexicon (“burner” here). Note also that you shuffle the word on each iteration. Entering the string “q” quits the program. Display each list of same-length words guessed in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>Print all words at the end of the game, as shown above.</p>
<p>If there are no words of a particular length, just ignore them altogether (note no words of length 5 below in “seaway” with a length range of 4 through 6):</p>
<pre>esaywa:

['away', '----', 'ayes', 'easy', 'sway', 'ways', 'yaws', 'yeas', 'yews']
['------']
</pre>
<p>You may find <strong>itertools.groupby</strong>, <strong>random.choice</strong>, and <strong>random.shuffle</strong> helpful.</p>
<p>Submit your code and a text file containing the transcript of a sample game session.</p>
<p>Hint: It is too time-consuming to check every permutation of subsets of letters for being a word for the game to be efficient. It is better to instead look at every possible word of the appropriate lengths in the dictionary and check to see if the letters are subsets of the sets of letters in the original, full-length word. Using <strong>collections.Counter</strong> makes easy work of this. (<strong>Counter</strong> is Python’s version of a “bag” data structure. You can use &lt;, &lt;=,&gt;, &gt;= as needed for checking containment. This functionality is new in Python 3.10.)</p>
<p>If a command-line argument is passed to the program, that argument should be used as the base word. For example, with the command below, the base word would be “stormy”:</p>
<pre>$ python3 wordgame.py stormy

571103,7191543,P6 HTML Photo Index,"<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118710790/canvas_global_app.css""><p>Write a Python program that will make an HTML index for a directory that is specified as a command-line parameter. The program should recursively traverse the directory tree of the specified directory and make an HTML index for each of the subdirectories.</p>
<p>The HTML index for each directory should display the name of the directory as a heading at the top of the page. It should include links to the index of each subdirectory. Each of the images in the directory should be displayed in the HTML index page below the links to subdirectories.</p>
<p>Each small image on an index page should be a link to the full-size image.</p>
<p>The file name should be displayed below each image. If the image has EXIF data (explained below) that includes a time stamp (date and time), then display the date and time below the file name. If it has EXIF data that includes GPS coordinates, use reverse geocoding (also explained below) to find the location where the image was taken and display the location under the time stamp.</p>
<p>Your program should recognize files with any of the following extensions (upper or lower case) as image files: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF</p>
<p>If a subdirectory does not include any image files, and none of its subdirectories contains image files, then a link for that subdirectory should not be displayed in the index. For example, in the sample index included in this assignment, there is a directory named Three. It contains images, so there is a link to Three on the index page for the Pictures directory. The Three directory has a subdirectory named ThreeA, and ThreeA has a subdirectory named ThreeA1. Neither ThreeA nor ThreeA1 has any images in it, so there is no link to ThreeA on the index page for Three.</p>
<p>Images and subdirectories should be sorted alphabetically. It's okay if they are sorted with capital letters coming before lower-case letters, as they are in the sample output shown below.</p>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>I don't expect you to have prior knowledge of HTML, but you will need to learn the basics of HTML to do this assignment. There is a good introduction to HTML on the Mozilla developer web site at <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML</a></p>
<p>Most or all of the HTML that you need for this assignment is in the templates that I provide below.</p>
<p>The Mozilla developer web site also has an introduction to CSS at <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS</a></p>
<p>All of the CSS you need for this assignment is in the templates that I provide, but you will do better if you understand the basics of CSS.</p>
<p>This file has some templates that you can use for generating HTML: <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""htmlTemplates.py"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/571103/files/118345009?verifier=6kP5PfWBKz7ZCV5OIG7QBWPbC6bvyCPON9N5jCzz&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/571103/files/118345009"" data-api-returntype=""File"">htmlTemplates.py</a></p>
<h3>Traversing directory trees</h3>
<p>In order to make an index page for a directory you will need to find out what files and subdirectories are in the directory. The <strong>os</strong> module provides several ways to do that, including <strong>os.scandir</strong> and <strong>os.listdir</strong>. <strong>listdir</strong> is easier to use, but <strong>scandir</strong> is probably better for this assignment because it returns a directory entry for each file or subdirectory in the directory. You can use the directory entry to tell if an entry is a subdirectory or a regular file.</p>
<p>Another function in the <strong>os</strong> module that is useful for this assignment is <strong>os.chdir</strong>, which you can use to change directories. You can use <strong>chdir('..')</strong> to change directories to the parent directory.</p>
<p>Since directory trees are trees, which are defined recursively, I recommend that you use a recursive function to travers the directory tree.</p>
<h3>Exif data</h3>
<p>Exif data is information about an image that digital cameras store with the image. It includes the type of camera, camera settings, the date and time that the photo was taken, and GPS coordinates of the location where it was taken. You can read about Exif information on this web site: <a href=""https://photographylife.com/what-is-exif-data"">https://photographylife.com/what-is-exif-data</a></p>
<p>For this assignment you will read the time stamp (which includes the date) and the GPS information from the Exif data. You can read Exif information using the <strong>ExifRead</strong> module. Since <strong>ExifRead</strong> is not a built-in module, you will need to install it with <strong>pip</strong>. This page tells how to install and use the module: <a href=""https://pypi.org/project/ExifRead/"">https://pypi.org/project/ExifRead/</a></p>
<p>The <strong>exifread.process_file</strong> function takes an open file as a parameter and returns a dictionary that has tag names as the dictionary keys. If there is no Exif information for a file then an empty dictionary will be returned.</p>
<p>You will need to use the following tags to get the time stamp and GPS location information:<br>■ <strong>Image DateTime</strong></p>
<p>■ <strong>GPS GPSLatitudeRef</strong><br>■ <strong>GPS GPSLatitude</strong><br>■ <strong>GPS GPSLongitudeRef</strong><br>■ <strong>GPS GPSLongitude</strong></p>
<p>I recommend that you write a small test program to experiment with <strong>exifread</strong> and see how it works before incorporating it into your main program.</p>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>You can use the <strong>reverse_geocoder</strong> module to get a location name for an image that has GPS data. You can read about the <strong>reverse_geocoder</strong> on these pages:<br>■ <a href=""https://pypi.org/project/reverse_geocoder/"">https://pypi.org/project/reverse_geocoder/</a><br>■ <a href=""https://github.com/thampiman/reverse-geocoder"">https://github.com/thampiman/reverse-geocoder</a></p>
<p>The Exif GPS values will be in the format of a string with degrees, minutes, and seconds (DMS) in a list. The seconds will often be in the form of a fraction, with a numerator, a slash, and then a denominator. Here's an example:<br>""[43, 28, 1407/500]""</p>
<p>For reverse geocoding you will need to parse that string and get numeric values for the degrees, minutes, and seconds. Then you'll need to convert the coordinate to a decimal degrees (DD) format, where each coordinate (latitude and longitude) is a single floating-point value. for example the DD format for the DMS coordinate above would be 43.46744833333334</p>
<p>The formula for converting from DMS to DD is:<br>DD = D + M/60 + S/3600<br>where D is degrees, M is minutes, and S is seconds.</p>
<p>If the <strong>GPSLatitudeRef</strong> value is ""N"" (for ""North"") then the latitude should be positive, but if it is ""S"" (South) then the latitude should be negative. Similarly, if the <strong>GPSLongitudeRef</strong> value is ""E"" (East) the longitude should be positive and if it is ""W"" (West) the longitude should be negative.</p>
<p>The <strong>reverse_geocoder.search</strong> function will return a list of dictionaries. Use the first dictionary in the list and display the <strong>name</strong>, <strong>admin1</strong>, and <strong>cc</strong> values as location information for the image. The <strong>name</strong> will be the name of the nearest city with a population of more than 1000. For the US, <strong>admin1</strong> will be the name of a state and for other countries it will be the name of a province or something similar. The <strong>cc</strong> value is a two-letter country code.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The only top-level code (not inside a function or class) in a file that uses <strong>reverse_geocoder</strong> should be in a block like this:</p>
<pre>if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Call functions to do reverse geocoding here
</pre>
<p>Otherwise you will get errors and strange behavior. I recommend that you put the reverse geocoding code in its own file rather than putting it in the same file as your main program.</p>
<h3>Sample output</h3>
<p>Here is a zip file that includes some directories with HTML index files generated for them: <a class=""instructure_file_link inline_disabled"" title=""Pictures.zip"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/571103/files/118345011?verifier=e25bua4qjeL9n1qFSpX9wJ0XcV3HDO7d2sYeTspL&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/571103/files/118345011"" data-api-returntype=""File"">Pictures.zip</a></p>
<p>Here's a picture of the index page for the top-level directory in the zip file, show links to three subdirectories and two images. One of the images has Exif information displayed and the other one doesn't because the image doesn't have Exif data.</p>

<p>The Internet is a complex client-server system with millions of computers connected via IP (Internet Protocol). The World-Wide Web is an abstract layer on top of the Internet where computers communicate via HTTP (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol). Web pages are text files requested and received through HTTP commands. All computers connected to the web have a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) that allows requests from browsers to find the destination server.</p>
<p>In this exercise you will write a simplistic web search engine that reads web pages and “ranks” them by how many links to them exist from other web pages. You will “crawl” the web starting with a given URL and follow its links to some level of search depth and report all URLs reached in <em>rank order</em> (explained below).</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>Write a class named <strong>HayStack</strong> whose constructor receives a URL and an optional search depth (defaulted to 3 levels). The constructor crawls starting from the given web page, finding and following all embedded webpage links until it reaches the maximum search depth and computes the following data items:</p>
<p>1. An <em>index</em> that maps every word encountered on each crawled page to a list of URLs of all the pages that contain that word. Only keep words consisting of runs of alphabetic characters and apostrophes. Convert all words to lower case. Only consider text that is found outside of HTML tags.</p>
<p>2.A <em>graph</em> that maps every URL encountered to a list of the web pages it links to directly. (This will be used subsequently for ranking web pages by “popularity”.)</p>
<p>Make sure you do not crawl a page twice! That could lead to an infinite loop.</p>
<p>Include also the following method in your <strong>HayStack</strong> class:</p>
<pre>   def compute_ranks(self, graph):
        d = 0.85     # probability that surfer will bail
        numloops = 10

        ranks = {}
        npages = len(graph)
        for page in graph:
            ranks[page] = 1.0 / npages

        for _ in range(0, numloops):
            newranks = {}
            for page in graph:
                newrank = (1 - d) / npages
                for url in graph:   
                    if page in graph[url]:  # this url links to page
                        newrank += d*ranks[url]/len(graph[url])
                newranks[page] = newrank
            ranks = newranks
        self.ranks = ranks
</pre>
<p>This function takes the graph mentioned above and “ranks” the web pages in <strong>graph</strong>, placing the result in a dictionary, self.<strong>ranks</strong>, where the key is the url and the value is the page’s rank. This is a simplified version of Google’s page ranking algorithm that made that search engine so famous decades ago.</p>
<p>Finally, write a <strong>lookup</strong> method that takes a word as a search key and outputs the webpages that contain that word in rank order, highest to lowest. See the sample output below.</p>
<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
<p>■ Name your file <em>search.py</em></p>
<p>■ You will test your code on a handful of web pages found at roversgame.net/cs3270. Make sure that your code runs with this test driver:</p>
<pre>if __name__ == '__main__':
    engine = HayStack('http://roversgame.net/cs3270/page1.html',4)
    for w in ['pages','links','you','have','I']:
        print(w)
        pprint.pprint(engine.lookup(w))
    print()
    print('index:')
    pprint.pprint(engine.index)
    print()
    print('graph:')
    pprint.pprint(engine.graph)
    print()
    print('ranks:')
    pprint.pprint({page:round(rank,4) for page,rank in engine.ranks.items()})
</pre>
<p>The test driver code above must be included in your program and work properly to get credit for this assignment.</p>
<p>■ You will need to include a <strong>User-Agent</strong> header in the request that your program sends to the server. Here's an example of doing that with <strong>urllib.request</strong>:</p>
<pre>req = urllib.request.Request(url, headers={'User-Agent' : 'XY'})
</pre>
<p>Here's an example of including a <strong>User-Agent</strong> header with the <strong>requests</strong> module:</p>
<pre>content = requests.get(url, headers={""User-Agent"": ""XY""}).text
</pre>
<p>Here's a simple program that uses urllib.request and requests to download a file: <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""urlopen.py"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/571103/files/117628706?verifier=t7ZbW1PPOkmpFlZi8W0eOieD4P2O3mCqq2taJl5c&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/571103/files/117628706"" data-api-returntype=""File"">urlopen.py</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>■ You only have to write about 30 lines of code. Redirect this output to a text file named <em>results.txt</em> and submit it along with your source code.</p>
<p>■ Do <em><strong>not</strong></em> use Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, or anything like them. Use regular expressions and&nbsp;<strong>urllib.request</strong> or <strong>requests</strong>.</p>
<p>■ Note that you will need to import Python’s <strong>pprint</strong> module (“pretty print”). The output is below.</p>

<p>You are aware that air pollution is a major problem in today’s world, causing respiratory issues for many individuals as well as contributing to global warming. One indicator of pollution is high ozone levels, caused in part by automobile hydrocarbon emissions.</p>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maintains ozone detection stations in various locations throughout the country. A key measure is the Air Quality Index (AQI). In the Canvas folder for this assignment is an 80mb (250,000+ lines) file named <em>daily_44201_2021.csv</em>, a CSV file containing all AQI data for 2021. (This is raw data downloaded directly from EPA’s website.) The first line of the file is a header row naming each column. The fields in each column of each data row are described below.</p>

<p>You will retrieve data by the names of the state and county (columns 25 and 26).</p>
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>In this project you will plot on demand all AQI data for a given county. The number of AQI entries varies for each county and are ordered chronologically. You just need to retrieve the AQI data (column 20) in the order it appears in the file and plot it. Annotate the plot with the state and county names, as well as the average AQI, as shown below.</p>
<p>Once the state and county have been selected, offer a choice of two destinations for the plot:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Display</strong> (the plot is shown on the screen)</li>
<li><strong>Save to File</strong> (the plot is saved to a file)</li>
</ol>
<p>Submit your source code along with plot files for</p>
<ul>
<li>Utah County, Utah</li>
<li>Santa Clara County, California</li>
<li>Wayne County, Michigan</li>
<li>Pima County, Arizona</li>
</ul>
<h1>Implementation Notes</h1>
<p>I spent quite a bit of time extracting which counties are in which state, so I will save you the trouble by giving you that information in the file <em>counties.txt</em> (also in the Canvas folder). However, you will need to make that information available at runtime. That should be the first thing your code does. Also, I have included a file, <em>state_codes.txt</em>, that associates the two-letter code for each state with their names as they appear in the data file.&nbsp;<a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""state_codes.txt"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/571103/files/118785100?verifier=Qbq1QqlTdbc98vrj9WcgJ8jDODRt5aJpd7lNsnXT&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/571103/files/118785100"" data-api-returntype=""File""></a></p>

<p>Use <strong>pandas</strong> for this project. Read the entire EPA file into a Pandas <strong>DataFrame</strong> with <strong>pandas.read_csv</strong> once (you do <em>not</em> need Python’s <strong>csv</strong> module). Use <strong>Dataframe </strong>indexing operations (either with brackets or the <strong>loc</strong> method) to locate the data needed for a selected plot. Pass the retrieved data to <strong>matplotlib</strong> for plotting.</p>
<p>This is one of the shortest projects (45 lines for me). It’s a project instead of an exercise because you’re dealing with some new concepts that’ll take a little thought to get going with.</p>

I recommend that you work in groups of two or three students.</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> Write a decorator that prints the time that it takes for a function to execute. You can use the timeit module to get the start time and end time of the function:</p>
<pre>from timeit import default_timer as timer
start = timer()
# ...
end = timer()
print(end - start) # Time in seconds
</pre>
<p>You might want to use time.sleep() to test your decorator. It takes a number of seconds (int or float) as its only parameter.</p>
<p><strong>Sample driver code</strong></p>
<pre>from timeit import default_timer as timer
import time as _time

# DECORATOR DEFINITION GOES HERE

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    @timedec
    def fun1(seconds):
        _time.sleep(seconds)

    fun1(2.5)
</pre>
<p><strong>Output</strong></p>
<pre>Code$ ./timedec1.py
2.50
Code$
</pre>
<p><strong>b)</strong>&nbsp;Modify the decorator so that it uses a function attribute to make a list of times for the function. Write code that is not part of the decorator to call the function ten times and print the list of times.</p>
<p><strong>Sample driver code</strong></p>
<pre>from timeit import default_timer as timer
import time as _time

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    @timedec
    def fun1(seconds):
        _time.sleep(seconds)

    for t in [.1, .2, .3, .4, .5, .6, .7, .8, .9]:
        fun1(t)

    print(fun1.times)
    print("", "".join(['{:.2f}'.format(t) for t in fun1.times]))

<p><strong>NOTES</strong><br>--Although a decorator like this might be useful, it isn't necessarily the best way to get timing information about code. Other options are to use Python profiling tools (https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/profile.html) or other functions in the timeit module (https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/timeit.html).<br>--It's fine to look up information about decorators in general, but for this exercise don't look up a decorator to time a function. The purpose of this exercise is to get practice with decorators, not practice looking things up on the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>TURN IN</strong><br>Put your decorator code (both versions) and drivers and sample output from Parts a and b into a text, Word, or PDF file and turn it in the file in Canvas.</p>

<li>Please copy the results and include them in you project 2 submission</li>
<li>Please note the partition value must include the keys. You may need to create a composite key.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Create a Stored Procedure / Function</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a stored procedure / function to query a table and have it accept a parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Database Views and User Access to Views</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a view on every table</li>
<li>Create the role ViewAll and add select permission on all tables to this role</li>
<li>Create a user and grant them the ViewAll role</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Create an Application Admin Role</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a role called AppAdmin</li>
<li>The role should have references, select, insert, update and delete on all tables</li>
<li>Create a user and grant that user the role AppAdmin</li>
</ul>
<p>5. Alter Tables</p>
<ul>
<li>Alter one of the tables by adding a new column</li>
<li>Alter a table and rename the table</li>
</ul>
<p>6. Primary Key (PK) and Foreign Key (FK) Constraints</p>
<ul>
<li>Create PK and FK constraints on all tables in your database</li>
</ul>
<p>7. Table Auditing using Triggers</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a ""history"" version for one of your tables</li>
<li>Create an update trigger that populates the ""history"" table</li>
<li>The ""history"" table should contain three extra columns
<ul>
<li>The user who made the change</li>
<li>A timestamp column containing a default of the current time</li>
<li>A column that indicates what is the new row and which is the old row</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An additional PK (I suggest a sequence number) is probably required on the ""history"" table because the trigger should contain before and after values for all columns of the source table. There are other choices for the PK</li>
</ul>
<p>8. Check Constraints</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a check constraint on at least two of your columns.</li>
</ul>
<p>9. Schema Creation and User Access</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a schema&nbsp;</li>
<li>Create a copy of one of your tables in that schema</li>
<li>Populate the new table in the schema with the data from the original table</li>
<li>Create a user and give that user select, references, update, delete and update to the new table created in the schema</li>
</ul>
<p>10. Application Report</p>
<ul>
<li>Create and describe in detail a query that functions as a report in your database.</li>
<li>This report should resemble a report a real user of your system would execute on a regular basis</li>
<li>Please create the query as a view</li>
<li>Take the MySQL or Postgres Python scripts I uploaded to Canvas</li>
<li>Modify the script to connect to your database</li>
<li>Create a query from your database and display the results</li>

<li>Group all students by major in the Students table</li>
<li>The query should also return the total count of students where more than 10000 are of that major</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the total count of Faculty by grouped by faculty rank order and order from largest&nbsp; to smallest</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a stored procedure (function in Postgresql) that performs the following:
<ul>
<li>Selects the facultyId, lastName, FirstName, department and faculty rank</li>
<li>The procedure accepts as input (parameter) the name of the department (I.E. CSC)</li>
<li>Call the stored procedure passing the 'History' department</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 4:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the Last Name and First Name for all CSC majors with between 0 and 59 credits from the Students table</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 5:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CSC department requires a separate table for only students who are CSC majors
<ul>
<li>Create a schema named CSC and create a copy of the Students table in the CSC schema</li>
<li>Select all CSC majors from the original Student table and insert the data into the new Students table in the CSC schema</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 6:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rename the column ""credits"" in the original Students table to ""totalCredits""</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Question 7:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the new column in the original Student table named totalCredits:
<ul>
<li>List all students who have the maximum number of credits (most credits) in the Student table and are Math majors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rename the column ""totalCredits"" in the original Students table back to ""credits""</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 8:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an index on the Students table for the last name column</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 9:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the column is_tenured with a default of ""N"" on the Faculty table</li>
<li>Update the Faculty table by changing the is_tenured column to 'Y' for all Faculty with the rank of Professor or Associate</li>
<li>Update the Faculty table by changing the is_tenured column to 'N' for all other Faculty ranks</li>
<li>Add a new Instructor (Your choice) and do not include the is_tenured column in the insert</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 10:</p>
<ul>
<li>Execute a Students Minus CSC.Students join</li>
<li>Hint: The query is correct if it displays all non CSC students</li>
<li>Hint 2: You will need to alias the original Students table</li>

<h1 class=""page-title"">Your Water Footprint</h1>
<p>For this activity I would like you to think about water consumption. Utah is the second driest state in the nation. The more information we have on water consumption, the more we can help conserve water. Let's find out how much water you and your family use.</p>
<p>This is a question that you might not think about too much, so now if your chance!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this assignment, you will first take the Water Footprint Calculator quiz here:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class=""external"" href=""https://www.watercalculator.org/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.watercalculator.org/<span class=""screenreader-only"">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a>&nbsp;After you answer a series of questions, you will get a result with your water use compared to the national average.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>After you have your results, read about water use in Utah here:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class=""external"" href=""https://geology.utah.gov/map-pub/survey-notes/glad-you-asked/does-utah-use-more-water/"" target=""_blank"">https://geology.utah.gov/map-pub/survey-notes/glad-you-asked/does-utah-use-more-water/<span class=""screenreader-only"">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answer the following questions about water use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; What was your average water use and how did it compare to the national average?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; List and describe 3 aspects of your water use that are high.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Do you think water use should be a concern to citizens and policy makers in Utah?&nbsp; Why or why not?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; How likely are you to make changes to your water consumption habits?&nbsp; Why or why not?&nbsp; What would compel you to change?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>A </span><span><strong>data visualization</strong></span><span>, also referred to as a data viz, is a visual representation of information and data. Visual elements like charts, graphs, plots, and maps are all examples of data visualizations and are accessible ways to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>As a business or data analyst, you will be working with data visualization software to bring your data to life. Learning how to best harness the power of Tableau is an excellent step toward your future as an analyst. Regardless of the size of the company you work for, if the company is collecting data, it will need data visualizations to help better understand relevant insights from the data. If you want to be able to visualize data using Tableau, you will first need to know how to navigate the tool itself.</span></p>

<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Today, businesses gather data on everything from external sales to internal employee productivity. By collecting this data, the company gains a huge advantage — they can uncover trends, address problem areas, and better serve their company.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Imagine you're starting on a new analytics project and are given the dataset below to explore. You need to find out whether the company was more profitable this year than last year. However, you notice that the dataset below has thousands of rows of data to look through!</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/582042/files/120323190/preview?verifier=LEUhKWYpcMpmvmNV7kzozr6EBovWGCPzu1ZI7C6T"" alt=""image.png"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/582042/files/120323190"" data-api-returntype=""File""></span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1"">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>How long would it take you to manually go through and determine whether the company was more profitable this year than the year before? Way too long! Now, consider the same data presented as a visualization. Within seconds, you should see that the company's profit has been growing every year.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/582042/files/120323193/preview?verifier=PPWW17FmCPtIXAAnasuWQX02iYH5JQnSMzv2DlVo"" alt=""image.png"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/582042/files/120323193"" data-api-returntype=""File""></span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Visualizations — like the one above — are the fastest way to condense data and share information. Staring at hundreds, thousands, or millions of rows of data does not help you understand trends in the data or answer questions for the company. Instead, clear visualizations of the data can lead to immediate insights and raise important questions for the larger team, not to mention save you, the analyst, <em>a lot</em> of time reaching those conclusions.</span></p>

<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Although this course is geared toward business intelligence, that is not the only career that works with data visualization. Generally, there are three main career categories that data viz work could be split into, as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><strong>Data visualization engineer</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><strong>Analyst or data scientist</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><strong>Other</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Continue below to read more about each of these categories.</span></p>
<h2 data-heading-variant=""h2regular""><span>Data Visualization Engineer</span></h2>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>A data visualization engineer is an expert in the design and development of data visualization and works collaboratively with software engineers, consultants, and many others to create data visualizations for the appropriate stakeholders.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>As a data visualization engineer, you should know how to develop data visualizations using both data viz tools (e.g., Tableau) and writing code to develop them from scratch. A data visualization engineer is also an expert in applying the theory of design to their work and is considered the data viz expert of their company.</span></p>
<h2 data-heading-variant=""h2regular""><span>Analyst or Data Scientist</span></h2>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>As an analyst or data scientist, you will be using data visualizations in your work nearly every day. Although the objective of your work is more around creating</span><span><em> insights</em></span><span> from your analysis — not so much creating the data visualizations themselves — knowing how to create and interpret data viz is still very important. As you've explored, one of the most effective ways to communicate discoveries with stakeholders is through data visualizations.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>As an analyst, you should know how to develop data visualizations using data viz tools like Tableau. Data scientists and some data analysts should also know how to develop data visualizations by coding them from scratch. Both an analyst and a data scientist should have a good understanding of visual design principles and best practices.</span></p>
<h2 data-heading-variant=""h2regular""><span>Other</span></h2>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>""Other"" is an umbrella for almost every other career out there. Not every career will involve </span><span><em>creating</em></span><span> data visualizations, but many do involve </span><span><em>interpreting</em></span><span> data visualizations. Generally speaking, you don't have to be in the data world to use a data viz. Regardless of whether or not you choose to go into analytics, the ability to develop or analyze data visualizations is a strong skill set to have in today's workforce.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>As an example, fields such as marketing employ digital marketers who have to create their own data visualizations using tools like Tableau. Even if you decide later that the analytics route is not for you, there is still a need for data visualization experience in other fields (e.g., marketing, education, entertainment, business). It is the ""hot new skill"" that recruiters are looking for on your resume. To explore how Tableau is applied in various industries, feel free to </span><span style=""background-color: #f1c40f;""><a class=""css-gcjbqe"" style=""background-color: #f1c40f;"" href=""https://www.tableau.com/solutions/industries"" target=""_blank"">examine a range of analytics solutions specific to each industry here.</a></span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Even more, traditional digital designers — like graphic designers — are not safe from the rise in data visualization. It is predicted that in the coming years, graphic designers will be using data visualizations in their everyday work and will closely collaborate with data experts to improve the quality of data visualizations. Read the following article if you're curious to learn more about the collaboration between data experts and traditional designers: </span><span><a class=""css-gcjbqe"" href=""http://modus.medium.com/is-data-visualization-the-next-design-challenge-ccbd6741b989"" target=""_blank""><em>Is <span style=""background-color: #f1c40f;"">Data Visualization the Next Design Challenge?</span></em></a></span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>So, why is it that data visualizations are so popular and effective, regardless of a person's career? To better answer this question, in the next reading, you will first explore how humans process visualizations.</span></p>

</div>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Human brains process complex data better when it's displayed in visualizations — as opposed to numbers and text — because of the balance in the human brain between perception and cognition. For instance, dealing with data organized in rows and columns, demands deliberate cognitive processing, thus necessitating heightened mental engagement. On the other hand, data visualizations allow the brain to focus on visual perception, which our brain can then interpret and process faster.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>This is why you see data visualizations all around you — in the news, social media, movies, emails, books, magazines — the list goes on and on. Regardless of the complexity of the data insight, a visual representation of data is a more efficient, simpler way for most humans to process the information. For this reason, it is essential to use graphics and visualizations to communicate insights to stakeholders.</span></p>

<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>This type of data visualization can take on many forms, as there is no specific data viz type dedicated to exploring data. Also, when you are exploring visualizations, they are considered a ""rough draft.""

<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>The goal of analyzing data is to discover patterns and trends that businesses can use to take informed actions. The actionable trends and patterns uncovered through data analysis are called</span><span><strong> insights</strong></span><span>. As an analyst, you want to be able to create strong insights to then share with the business.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Suppose you’ve just been given a dataset and have been asked to produce insights. What does that process look like? While it’s not a set-in-stone, linear process, it may look something like this:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Explore the data:</strong></span><span> You’ll first want to get a general idea of what data you have available to analyze.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Wrangle the data:</strong></span><span> After you have a better understanding of what you’re working with, you’ll want to wrangle the data, which involves cleaning and reformatting it so that it will be easier to analyze. For example, suppose you have data where a single column contains numbers, but some of them are written as numbers and some are written as words — for example, ""14"" and ""five."" In this case, you wouldn’t be able to create a visualization or perform any calculations until the word ""five"" is reformatted into the number ""5.""</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Create data visualizations: </strong></span><span>Now, with the data wrangled, it’s time to start creating exploratory data visualizations, which are used to uncover relationships in the data. Remember, these are your ""rough drafts,"" so you don’t need to follow any visual design or data viz best practices as you create these visualizations. It is also at this time when you may calculate statistics to further explore the data. Eventually, after creating enough exploratory data visualizations and calculating enough statistics, you’ll start to uncover relationships, which will help you develop insights.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Produce insights:</strong></span><span> As you’re developing your insights, you’ll want to fine-tune and clean up your </span><span><em>exploratory</em></span><span> data visualizations by following best practices so that they can be used to help you </span><span><em>explain</em></span><span> your insights to stakeholders. You may also find yourself creating new data visualizations to help explain your insights. Additionally, you’ll want to calculate any additional statistics to help support your data visualizations.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Note that every now and then, you may have the opportunity to take your insights to another level by creating data visualizations used to </span><span><em>exhibit</em></span><span>, although these data visualizations are far less common. Nevertheless, this may still be a part of the process.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Throughout this course, you will build data visualizations with the goal of</span><span><em> exploring </em></span><span>and </span><span><em>explaining.</em></span><span> Additionally, you’ll learn the appropriate skills to be able to create your own data visualizations with the goal of </span><span><em>exhibiting, </em></span><span>if/when you need to do so.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Note: For your ""Final Project"",</strong> I will be asking you to </span></p>
<p><span>1) Design/create a survey to collect the data or </span></p>
<p><span>2) Use your own (structured) data or </span></p>

<p><span>Note: A different way to look at this assignment is: At your job - you will be responsible to analyze the data, have a ""data story"" in mind, create the appropriate dashboards and tell a story. Therefore, treat these assignments as a practice for you to polish your skills and prepare for ""impressive data story telling after data analysis &amp; dashboard creation"".</span></p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,50.0,"['online_text_entry', 'online_upload']"

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this exercise, you will create a dashboard to track customer purchasing habits.&nbsp; Specifically, we will be doing an RFM analysis (RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary value) of customers.&nbsp; You will use the Superstore dataset, a very popular Tableau dataset that is supposed to be modeled after a store like Staples or OfficeMax (they sell office supplies to small and medium-sized businesses).</p>

<p>This assignment is just to get you back (or started) into Excel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many students are required, when applying for data analyst-type roles, to pass an Excel test as a preliminary step.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This assignment has been modeled after one that a tech company required job applicants to take (and complete in less than 30 minutes).&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This assessment is particularly relevant when hiring for roles that require working with data, such as Data Analysts, Business Analysts, Financial Analysts, and Market Research Analysts. These roles involve tasks like data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and reporting, and Excel is a widely used tool for performing these functions.</span></p>
<p><span>By evaluating these sub-skills, employers can identify candidates who possess the necessary competencies to work with data efficiently, make data-driven decisions, and contribute to the success of the organization. Candidates who perform well in the Data Analyst Excel assessment demonstrate their analytical thinking, attention to detail, problem-solving abilities, and proficiency in utilizing Excel as a powerful tool for data analysis.</span></p>
<p>Because this is your first real assignment, step-by-step instructions will be provided (by our lead instructor for Business Analytics via YouTube video).&nbsp; After completing the spreadsheet, upload your spreadsheet (Excel File Format Only).&nbsp; If you follow the steps in the video, you should get 100%.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Part 1:</strong>&nbsp; Install Tableau Desktop on your computer.&nbsp; Tableau is normally quite expensive ($840 per year--a beautiful business model if you can get it!), but they offer it to students free for a year.&nbsp; To activate your student subscription, go to <a class=""instructure_file_link inline_disabled"" href=""https://www.tableau.com/academic/students"" target=""_blank"">Tableau for Students</a> and click on ""Free Student License"" in the top right corner.&nbsp; You will have to enter some personal info and scan and upload a copy of your student ID.</li>
<li>
</li><li>
<strong>Part 2:</strong> Go to <a class=""instructure_file_link inline_disabled"" href=""https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/"" target=""_blank"">Tableau Public</a> and create an author account.&nbsp; This is so that you can create your own portfolio or gallery.&nbsp; (It's a bit like creating a LinkedIn Profile).&nbsp; Don't worry--we're only going to upload polished dashboards to this site.&nbsp; However, it comes in handy when interviewing with companies and they ask, ""what have you done in Tableau"" and you can show them your profile page.</li>
</ul>
<p>BTW, here is Professor Benson's <a class=""instructure_file_link inline_disabled"" href=""https://public.tableau.com/profile/david.f.benson#!/?newProfile=&amp;activeTab=0"" target=""_blank"">Tableau Public profile page</a> (if you're looking for inspiration for dashboards to make, you can click on Professor Benson's ""Favorites"" tab and favorited 500+ visualizations that you might like).</p>

<p>Please read and understand the following content (review/understand at least twice) and then take the quiz.</p>
<p>Expected reading time = 20 minutes.</p>
<h3>Learning Objective:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Differentiate between BI, data analytics, data science, and data engineering.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>You have learned about the differences between specializations such as business intelligence, data analytics, data engineering, and data science. Now, let's look at the differences in the roles in these fields.</p>
<h3>BI analyst</h3>
<p>A BI analyst develops BI solutions through various analytical and visualization tools. They build reports that enable stakeholders to make crucial business decisions. They design and maintain data models, create reports and dashboards, and work with stakeholders to identify key performance indicators (KPIs). BI differs from data analytics because it primarily focuses on data visualization, storytelling, reporting, and dashboard creation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Excel</li>
<li>Tableau</li>
<li>Power BI</li>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>NoSQL DB</li>
<li>Data warehousing tools</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data analyst</h3>
<p>Data analytics is a process of formatting, cleaning, and adapting unstructured or raw information into meaningful feedback. A data analyst employs descriptive analysis and static modeling approaches to summarize the data. However, BI uses inputs from data analytics to determine business growth strategies. Unlike BI, data analytics draws on techniques like exploratory data analysis, predictive analysis, and hypothesis testing. It digs deeper into technical skills by leveraging Python, forecasting, and partially automating data analysis. Data analysts use data to describe the past and present, whereas data scientists use it to predict future outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Average salary:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>$65,112<br><strong>Salary range:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>$47,000–$89,000<br><strong>Skills required:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SQL is the primary language with Python used for statistical work and automation</li>
<li>Platform tools such as Python and SQL IDEs</li>
<li>Data visualization and statistical analysis tools</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data Engineer</h3>
<p>Data engineers provide stable and highly optimized data pipelines and systems that enable data scientists to execute their algorithms. They are responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the infrastructure needed for data storage, processing, and analysis. The main goal of data engineers is to create a single source of truth for the users of data and provide them with highly reliable, usable data in real time.</p>
<p><strong>Average salary:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>$115,000<br><strong>Salary range:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>$82,000–$168,000<br><strong>Skills required:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Programming languages such as Scala and Go</li>
<li>Data integration tools such as Microsoft SSIS, Talend, Cognos Data Manager</li>
<li>Big Data frameworks such as Hadoop or Spark</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data Scientist</h3>
<p>Data scientists dig into the specifics of data, using advanced statistics and predictive analytics to discover patterns and forecast future patterns. They use mathematical, statistical, and programming skills to gain insights from data and then use those insights to build machine learning models.</p>
<p><strong>Average salary:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>$98,789<br><strong>Salary range:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>$70,000–$137,000<br><strong>Skills required:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Programming languages such as SQL, R, Python, Java, C/C++</li>
<li>Platform tools such as data science and machine learning platforms, for example, Jupyter Notebooks, MATLAB, KNIME, MS Azure-learning Studio, IBM Watson Machine Learning, etc.</li>
<li>BI tools such as Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Qlik, etc.</li>
<li>Databases such as SQL/NoSQL databases, cloud databases</li>
<li>Other skills such as AI/ML skills, cloud computing, APIs, statistics, and mathematics</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a nutshell, all the specializations such as BI, data analytics, data engineering, and data science rely on data, but their focus and how they analyze that data differs.</p>

<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>As you have been learning, a business’s ability to identify issues before they become problems or act on opportunities before their competition is key to intelligent decision-making. Now more than ever, we have access to data about our marketplace, organizations, customers, competitors, and employees. But in order to turn that data into rapid results, we need business intelligence. Business intelligence involves automating processes and information channels in order to transform relevant data into actionable insights that are easily available to decision-makers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>In this reading, you’re going to explore two examples of how BI has helped real businesses gain insights, access the right data, and find ways to grow and improve their processes to put those insights to work.&nbsp;</span></p>

</div>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Consider a fictitious scenario about a fast-food restaurant chain. Leaders at this company have huge amounts of data to manage, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>customer transactions</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>marketing data related to promotions</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>customer satisfaction</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>employee information</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>And so much more! But on top of all of that, the company also has to consider the logistics for individual restaurants. That’s where the problem comes in.</span></p>
<h3><span>The problem</span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>The restaurants need to have ingredients to cook and serve customers, but if they have too much, that extra stock often goes to waste. Company leadership consults with their BI team to consider how to approach two concerns:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>How to ensure the restaurants’ numerous locations have enough ingredients to meet customer demand</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>How to reduce food waste</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>However, these stakeholders currently don’t have metrics in place to specifically measure food waste or strategies to reduce it. This is exactly where the BI team will need to start.</span></p>
<h3><span>The solution</span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>In order to address the stakeholder’s needs, the BI team spends time gathering information about current metrics and processes. They first use this information to determine what data they have and how it’s being used. They discover that there are already useful metrics being applied in other ways by various teams in the company, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>How many ingredients are delivered to each location</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>How much of each menu item is made each day</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>How much of each menu item is actually being ordered each day</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>By comparing these existing metrics, the company can better understand how much food is going to waste. Thus, the BI analysts are able to gather the necessary information on incoming food delivery, customer orders, and food consumption in the form of a dashboard for stakeholders to monitor food waste. The BI analysts then organize this data within the database systems and deliver it to new tables that report the results for stakeholders to consider as they strategize how to reduce food waste.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>The results</span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Knowing how much food is actually going to waste now enables stakeholders to better achieve their goals. The restaurant chain discovers that the largest source of food waste is the French fries. Across their locations, 10–20% of French fries are left over at the end of the month. With this information, the company’s central operations team sends out a memo to all branches recommending they reduce their incoming French fry delivery by 10%. In this way, the BI analysts are able to help the business identify an area for improvement and reduce waste.&nbsp;</span></p>

</div>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Hospitals also have to manage a lot of different kinds of data — especially patient information. They also have a variety of data sources that they need to access and share to ensure that other connected users — such as doctors working outside of the hospital — can get patients the treatment they need without wasting time or resources.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>The problem</span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>For this scenario, consider a hospital system that’s challenged to communicate effectively with doctors who don’t work within the same hospital system. Administrators have noticed that this creates a few different problems:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Doctors outside of the system can’t access test results from the hospital</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Patients are being tested multiple times</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>This is expensive and inefficient, both for the hospital and patients. So, decision-makers choose to work with a team of BI specialists to create database systems that get data in the hands of doctors who need it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>The solution</span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Basically, this hospital system is experiencing a problem related to inaccessible patient data. There is a lot of data streaming in from multiple source systems that needs to be consolidated into one destination that can be used by doctors, including information about:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Previous visits</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Tests</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Allergies</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>And other relevant medical information. So, the BI team develops a pipeline system that ingests data from all key sources, processes and transforms it so that it is consistent, and delivers it to a database system where doctors are able to access all the information they need.</span></p>
<h3><span>The results</span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>By streamlining the hospital’s many data sources into one consolidated database, the BI team helps save the hospital money and resources by eliminating duplicate tests. Now, doctors are better able to treat patients, patients save money on redundant tests and procedures, and the hospital can run more efficiently. This is all thanks to the tools built by the BI team!</span></p>
<h2><span>Key takeaways</span></h2>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>No matter what industry you’re working in, BI can automate processes and information channels to empower the people who need that data to answer questions and make decisions. From restaurants reducing waste to hospitals advancing patient care, BI analysts create systems and tools to anticipate needs and enable organizations to reach their objectives.&nbsp;</span></p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,10.0,['online_quiz']

<p data-text-variant=""body1"">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1"">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Previously, you learned about the many different partners a business intelligence professional might team up with to create systems and tools for an organization to improve processes and provide stakeholders with ongoing insights. These partners could include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>API professionals</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Data warehousing specialists</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Data governance professionals</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Data analysts</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>IT professionals</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Project managers</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>And many more!</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Complex business problems require collaboration and cross-team cooperation. These partners have unique knowledge, experience, skills, and perspectives to bring to the table. Brainstorming and building together, pooling knowledge, and fleshing out issues is essential to the BI process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Tackling complex problems is related to a concept you might already be familiar with if you completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate: structured thinking. Structured thinking is the process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options. Basically, structured thinking allows you to break a problem down into manageable pieces.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>The same is true for BI. Often, you have a complex problem with a lot of pieces to consider; by using a structured approach and breaking down the problem to manageable pieces, the process to solve the issue and get results is much easier. And your partners in the organization are a great resource along the way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Now, let’s explore some examples of BI professionals collaborating with their partners to solve problems and provide insights to stakeholders that empower decision-making.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Managing membership data</span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>The marketing team for a retail store was looking for ways to increase memberships for its loyalty program. Leaders wanted to encourage repeat customers to enroll. However, they didn’t have a system in place that allows analysts to explore both member and nonmember sales data. This requires ingesting data from a variety of systems, including the store’s online membership form and sales data. So, in addition to building a tool that moves and transforms key data, the BI team also needed to make the data from different systems align with the destination system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>In this case, they collaborated with several teams:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>The marketing team</strong></span><span>: The marketing team was the primary stakeholder for this initiative. They worked with the BI team to determine project requirements, timelines, and deliverables.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>The API team</strong></span><span>: Next, the BI team collaborated with the API professionals in order to integrate the data into the internal company database. The API team also helped build the reporting tools and dashboards.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Data warehousing specialists</strong></span><span>: Then they teamed up with data warehousing specialists to create a storage and organization system for the newly acquired data.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>In the end, the marketing team was empowered with a system that allowed them to access the data they needed to explore customer trends and strategize ways to increase membership for their loyalty program.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Securing sensitive data</span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Another BI professional was working at a tech company that creates health-monitoring tools such as smart watches. The data analysts on their team were interested in exploring user data to find out how customers are using their products. Because some personally identifiable information was included, it was critical that all data be anonymized and secured.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>The BI team partnered with the data warehousing specialists and data governance team in order to make sure that the storage systems protected the users while allowing data analysts to draw insights. In the end, the data analysts were able to use the smart watch data to explore trends and provide insights while still maintaining the privacy of users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Key takeaways</span></h2>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Collaborating with the people on your team who have different skills and perspectives is an important part of a structured approach to BI. As a BI professional, you will collaborate with a variety of partners to create systems that empower stakeholders with data to advance and succeed.&nbsp;</span></p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,10.0,['online_quiz']

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>List of Key Team Members who collaborate to fulfill a data request:</p>
<p><strong>1) </strong><span><strong>Project Manager:</strong> Defines the work</span></p>
<p><span>The&nbsp;<strong>project manager</strong>&nbsp;starts gathering requirements, defines the project scope, and prepares the timeline. You have daily check-ins with them to confirm alignment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>2) Business Stakeholder:</strong> Initiates project</span></p>
<p><span>The&nbsp;<strong>chief operating officer (COO)</strong>&nbsp;sends you an email asking for a way to track how the company’s travel spending compares to the travel budget for the current fiscal year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3) Business Intelligence Professional: </strong>You find the right data</p>
<p><span>As the business intelligence professional on the project, you meet with the sales and finance team. You learn that company travel details are in an in-house expense system, and budgets are in the company’s planning software.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>4) Application Programming Interface Engineer: </strong>Helps access the data</span></p>
<p><span>Now that you know where the data is, you need access. You ask an&nbsp;<strong>application programming interface engineer</strong>&nbsp;to help get the data. They write Python programs that pull data from the two systems and deliver it into a data warehouse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>5) Data Specialists:</strong> Clean the data</span></p>
<p><span>Now that the raw spend and budget data is in a warehouse,&nbsp;<strong>data warehousing specialists</strong>&nbsp;clean and standardize the data, validate it, and deliver it into a BigQuery&nbsp;</span>database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6) Data Governance Professional: </strong><span>Review for data governance</span></p>
<p><span>With the data available as analyst-ready tables in a BigQuery database, a</span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>data governance professional</strong><span>&nbsp;makes sure the data has proper access controls in&nbsp;</span>place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7) Data Analysts: </strong><span>Analyze the data with data analysts</span></p>
<p><span>Working closely with&nbsp;</span><strong>data analysts</strong><span>, you understand the data, identify key fields, and conduct a preliminary analysis. Then, you merge travel history data with budget data in order to answer your COO’s question about how travel spend compares with the&nbsp;</span>budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8) Create a dashboard and present results</strong></p>
<p><span>Because the COO also wants to monitor travel spend going forward, you build an insights dashboard that’s connected to the data warehouse. Then, you prepare a short slide presentation to share the results of the project with the COO.</span></p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,10.0,['online_quiz']

<p>A business intelligence strategy<span>&nbsp;is the management of the people, processes, and tools used in the business intelligence process. </span></p>
<p><span>BI projects are complicated, and finding ways to stay organized from the beginning of a project to the end is key to success. One way to ensure that you capture the big-picture project requirements, stay organized, and make an impact at your organization is to create comprehensive BI documents. In this reading, you’ll learn about three types of documents: <strong>the Stakeholder Requirements Document, Project Requirements Document, and Strategy Document.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Each of these documents builds on the previous one. Instead of three separate documents, think about them as three phases of your project planning process. Later on, you will have an opportunity to create your own BI documents to guide your end-of-course project, so this is a great resource to get you started!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 data-heading-variant=""h2semibold""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>1) Stakeholder Requirements Document</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>The Stakeholder Requirements Document enables you to capture stakeholder requests and requirements,&nbsp;so you understand their needs before planning the rest of the project details or strategy. It should answer the following questions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Business problem: What is the primary question to be answered or problem to be solved?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Stakeholders: Who are the major stakeholders of this project, and what are their job titles?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Stakeholder usage details: How will the stakeholders use the BI tool?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Primary requirements: What requirements must be met by this BI tool in order for this project to be successful?</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Here are some questions BI professionals ask in order to successfully complete this document:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>What questions must be answered before starting this project?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>What does the BI team need to know before starting this project?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>What are the questions that must be answered/problems that must be solved by this project?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>What datasets are considered important to this project?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Who should have access to the dashboard? Will the entire dashboard be visible to all stakeholders?</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Typically, the Stakeholder Requirements Document is a one-pager with notes, but it can be longer and more detailed for complex projects.</span></p>
<p><span>Click the link to access the stakeholder requirements document template or&nbsp;download the file directly from the attachment below.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""1- Template - Stakeholder-Requirements-Document-.docx"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/582042/files/120696204?verifier=FncRAyqgribKsOZRL2kOyCJLgilqm50FbDWEbNtL&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/582042/files/120696204"" data-api-returntype=""File"">1- Template - Stakeholder-Requirements-Document-.docx</a></span></p>
<h2 data-heading-variant=""h2semibold""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>2) Project Requirements Document</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>Once you have established the stakeholder requirements, you can start thinking about the project requirements that need to be met to achieve the stakeholder requirements. The Project Requirements Document contains the following details:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Purpose: Briefly describe why this project is happening and explanation of why the company should invest its resources in it.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Key dependencies: Detail the major elements of this project. Include the team, primary contacts, and expected deliverables. Are there any inter-team deliverables required?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Stakeholder requirements: List the established stakeholder requirements, based on the Stakeholder Requirements Document. Prioritize the requirements as: R - required, D - desired, or N - nice to have.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Success criteria: Clarify what success looks like for this project. Include explicit statements about how to measure success. Use SMART criteria.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>User journeys: Document the current user experience and the ideal future experience.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Assumptions: Explicitly and clearly state any assumptions you are making.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Compliance and privacy: Include compliance, privacy, or legal dimensions to consider.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Accessibility: List key considerations for creating accessible reports for all users. Who needs to access this feature? How are they viewing and interacting with it?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Roll-out plan: Briefly describe the expected scope, priorities and timeline. Consider at what points during the rollout will measurements be made to determine whether the feature is performing as expected? Is there a rollback plan and timeline if this feature does not meet its intended goals?</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>In addition, some companies will ask you to include a list of references. If so, it’s a best practice to be liberal in citing references; you can never have too many. References might include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Documents or websites you read and researched while working on this project</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Laws and policies: Any regulations driving the project requirements</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Project tracking: A link to tracking spreadsheet, bug hotlist, etc.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Similar projects: A description of anything similar that has been attempted in the past or any parallel efforts.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Similar to the Stakeholder Requirements Document, the Project Requirements Document will vary depending on the complexity of the project. It might just be an email sent out to stakeholders to keep them updated on expectations and check-in points, or it could be a multi-page document with a spreadsheet that outlines the project plan and key tasks.</span></p>

<h2 data-heading-variant=""h2semibold""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>3) Strategy Document</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>Finally, you will create a Strategy Document for your project. This is the final phase of the planning process. The Strategy Document is a collaborative place to align with stakeholders about project deliverables. You will work together to establish information about dashboard functionality and associated metrics and charts.</span></p>
<p><span>This is a time to flesh out what metrics will be required, how metrics are calculated, and any limitations or assumptions that exist about the data. Stakeholders think through these details and help the BI professional make final project decisions. Then, the BI professional provides stakeholders with a dashboard mockup to get valuable feedback.</span></p>
<p><span>Generally, the BI professional will create the document and request review and sign-off from important stakeholders. Then they can begin working on the project with all of the details they need.</span></p>
<p><span>Click the link to access the strategy document template or&nbsp;download the file directly from the attachment below.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #f1c40f;""><a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" style=""background-color: #f1c40f;"" title=""3 - Template_-Strategy-Document.docx"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/582042/files/120696206?verifier=uyPqL199qCsDfuhYWyl738n9jC6LIPlzTCdIsdaP&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/582042/files/120696206"" data-api-returntype=""File"">3 - Template_-Strategy-Document.docx</a></span></p>
<p><span>Staying organized and aligned with stakeholders is an important part of the BI process. Creating documents early on in a project to outline stakeholder and project requirements as well as project strategies can be an important tool for a BI professional aligning with stakeholders and planning ahead. Soon, you’ll have an opportunity to create your own documents to align with stakeholders and plan your end-of-course project!</span></p>

<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>MarkIt maintains an online platform that facilitates previously-owned item sales between individual buyers and sellers. The goal is to understand how these buyers and sellers use their platform. The insights could then inform new-product design and improve the platform.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>The team wants to review data that tracks the number of listings posted; the number of sales completed; and the number of listings deleted on a daily, quarterly, and yearly timescale. They also want to better understand search query behavior that buyers have when searching for an item. For example, if a buyer searches for more different types of items, are they more or less likely to complete a purchase? Do broader search terms mean a user is less committed to making a purchase?</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Project goals:</strong></span></p>

</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Understand how the platform is used by both types of users: How much time do users spend on the site? What pages do they spend the most time on? How do buyers conduct searches, and how do sellers create and maintain listings? How do buyers and sellers contact one another?</span></p>

<h3><span><strong>Step 1: Access the templates</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>To use the templates for this course item, click the following links and select “Use Template.” </span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1"">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span><strong>Step 2: Fill out the Stakeholder Requirements Document</strong></span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Use your meeting notes to fill out as much of the stakeholder requirements document template as you can. If you find that there are some fields that you can’t fill out, make note of them for later in the exercise.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>The Stakeholder Requirements Document enables you to capture stakeholder requests and requirements so you understand their needs before planning the rest of the project details or strategy. It should answer the following questions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Business problem</strong></span><span>: What is the primary question to be answered or problem to be solved?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Stakeholders</strong></span><span>: Who are the major stakeholders of this project, and what are their job titles?&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Stakeholder usage details</strong></span><span>: How will the stakeholders use the BI tool?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Primary requirements</strong></span><span>: What requirements must be met by this BI tool in order for this project to be successful?&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Here are some questions BI professionals ask to successfully complete this document:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>What questions must be answered before starting this project?&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>What does the BI team need to know before starting this project?&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>What are the questions that must be answered and/or problems that must be solved by this project?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>What datasets are considered important to this project?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Who should have access to the dashboard? Will the entire dashboard be visible to all stakeholders?</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Typically, the Stakeholder Requirements Document is a one-page document with notes, but it can be longer and more detailed for complex projects.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1"">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span><strong>Step 3: Fill out the Project Requirements Document</strong></span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Use your meeting notes to fill out as much of the project requirements document template as you can. If you find that there are some fields that you can’t fill out, make note of them for later in the exercise.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>The Project Requirements Document contains the following details:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Purpose</strong></span><span>: Briefly describe why this project is happening and explain why the company should invest its resources in it.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Key dependencies</strong></span><span>: Detail the major elements of this project. Include the team, primary contacts, and expected deliverables. Are any inter-team deliverables required?&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Stakeholder requirements</strong></span><span>: List the established stakeholder requirements, based on the Stakeholder Requirements Document. Prioritize the requirements as: R (required), D (desired), or N (nice to have).</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Success criteria: Clarify what success looks like for this project. Include explicit statements about how to measure success.&nbsp;</span></p>
<span><strong>User journeys</strong></span><span>: Document the current user experience and the ideal future experience.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Assumptions</strong></span><span>: Explicitly and clearly state any assumptions you are making.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Compliance and privacy</strong></span><span>: Include any compliance, privacy, or legal dimensions to consider.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Accessibility</strong></span><span>: List key considerations for creating accessible reports for all users. Who needs to access this feature? How are they viewing and interacting with it?&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Roll-out plan</strong></span><span>: Briefly describe the expected scope, priorities, and timeline. Consider at what points during the rollout will measurements be made to determine whether the feature is performing as expected? Is there a rollback plan and timeline if this feature does not meet its intended goals?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span><strong>Step 4: Fill out the Strategy Document</strong></span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Use your meeting notes to fill out as much of the strategy document template as you can. If you find that there are some fields that you can’t fill out, make note of them for later in the exercise.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>The Strategy Document is a collaborative place to align with stakeholders about project deliverables. You will work together to establish information about dashboard functionality and associated metrics and charts.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>This is a time to explore what metrics will be required, how metrics are calculated, and any limitations or assumptions that exist about the data. Stakeholders think through these details and help the BI professional make final project decisions. Then, the BI professional provides stakeholders with a dashboard mockup to get useful feedback.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Generally, the BI professional will create the document and request review and sign-off from stakeholders. Then, they can begin working on the project with all of the details they need.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1"">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span><strong>Step 5: Write follow-up questions for your client</strong></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;<span>By now, you’ve filled out each of the templates with information from the interview. But you might have noticed that you’re missing some information for fields in the template. In a professional setting, you might need to ask a client follow-up questions to properly complete planning documents.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Write 3–5 questions about information that is missing from the interview notes. In a professional setting, you could ask these questions to your client to help you fully complete your documents.</span></p>
<h3><span><strong>Pro Tip: Save the template</strong></span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the templates you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your professional projects. These templates will help you work through your thought processes and demonstrate your experience to potential employers.</span></p>

<h2 data-heading-variant=""h2semibold""><strong><span style=""font-size: 24pt;"">Assessment of 3-Completed Examples shown above:</span></strong></h2>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>The examples shown above will help you visualize a real-world scenario, so part of your task will be to identify what information you are missing information (after initial assessment and initial completion) and come up with follow-up questions you could ask the stakeholder. This activity will prepare you to complete these forms in future projects throughout your career.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Project planning docs help you understand the needs and expectations of your stakeholders. This allows you to communicate with them effectively and better understand how to complete the project. You will be able to determine what information will most help you meet the project needs.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Your documents don’t have to perfectly match these examples. The goal is to properly organize the information into the correct fields and understand how planning documents help you prepare for a BI project. This is an opportunity for you to check your understanding, ensure that you’ve met the activity’s expectations, and explore a possible solution.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>In the </span><span><strong>Stakeholder Requirements Document example</strong></span><span>, you’ll notice that areas where you’re missing information are highlighted in bold. In your own projects, you might find it helpful to note what you’re missing directly on the document. Then, when you ask follow-up questions, you can replace those notes with the correct information.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Most of the information in these docs is pulled directly from the notes in the activity’s scenario. You might also reword something to summarize or expand on notes from the meeting. For example, the notes include “The goal is to understand how these buyers and sellers use their platform. The insights could then inform new-product design and improve the platform.” You might translate this into the business problem section of the planning doc by wording it as “How do buyers and sellers use MarkIt’s platform? How can MarkIt improve their platform?” This frames the language in the notes as a question instead of a statement.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>In the </span><span><strong>Project Requirements Document&nbsp;</strong></span><span><strong>example</strong>, you need to assign each of the stakeholder’s requests as “required,” “desired,” or “nice to have.” A hint for what belongs where can be found in the language the stakeholders use. In the scenario notes, some of the requests might have “must,” while others might have “can we?” or “should.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>You’ll also find that this document has more fields that are missing information. This can provide clues about what you should ask in follow-up meetings.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>The </span><span><strong>Strategy Document example</strong></span><span>&nbsp;is the longest document and has more missing information. But because this is the stage where you can determine what kinds of charts you might make, many of your answers can be left to your best judgment. Unless the stakeholder tells you what kinds of charts they want, you will need to use your BI expertise to decide what works best. In this scenario, the stakeholders didn’t give you any chart type suggestions. This means you can make the decisions yourself or decide to follow up with the stakeholder for more guidance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>The Strategy Document is also where you might include a sketch of a mockup.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p data-text-variant=""body1"">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>As you continue through this class, you will be introduced to a variety of business intelligence tools that will help you create systems and processes and provide stakeholders with insights they can use to guide business decisions. Depending on the organization, you might end up using different tools over time. Luckily, the skills you are learning now can be transferred between tools. In this reading, you’ll be given some best practices for creating pipeline tools, data visualizations, and dashboards that you’ll be able to apply no matter what programs or tools your organization uses.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Optimal Pipeline Processes</span></h2>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Developing tools to optimize and automate certain data processes is a large part of a BI professional’s job. Being able to automate processes such as moving and transforming data saves users from having to do that work manually and empowers them with the ability to get answers quickly for themselves. There are a variety of tools that BI professionals use to create pipelines; and although there are some key differences between them, these are many best practices that apply no matter what tool you use.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Modular design</span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>As you have learned, a data pipeline is a series of processes that transport data from different sources to their final destination for storage and analysis. A pipeline takes multiple processes and combines them into a system that automatically handles the data. Modular design principles can enable the development of individual pieces of a pipeline system so they can be treated as unique building blocks. Modular design also makes it possible to optimize and change individual components of a system without disrupting the rest of the pipeline. In addition, it helps users isolate and troubleshoot errors quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Other best practices related to modular design include using version control to track changes over time and undo any as needed. Also, BI professionals can create a separate development environment to test and review changes before implementing them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Other general software development best practices are also applicable to data pipelines.</span></p>
<h3><span>Verify data accuracy and integrity</span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>The BI processes that move, transform, and report data findings for analysis are only useful if the data itself is accurate. Stakeholders need to be able to depend on the data they are accessing in order to make key business decisions. It’s also possible that incomplete or inaccurate data can cause errors within a pipeline system. Because of this, it’s necessary to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data, no matter what tools you are using to construct the system. Some important things to consider about the data in your pipelines are:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Completeness</strong></span><span>: Is the data complete?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Consistency</strong></span><span>: Are data values consistent across datasets?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Conformity</strong></span><span>: Do data values conform to the required format?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Accuracy</strong></span><span>: Do data values accurately represent actual values?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Redundancy</strong></span><span>: Are data values redundant within the same dataset?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Integrity</strong></span><span>: Are data values missing important relationships?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span><strong>Timeliness</strong></span><span>: Is the data current?</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Creating checkpoints in your pipeline system to address any of these issues before the data is delivered to the destination will save time and effort later on in the process! For example, you can add SQL scripts that test each stage for duplicates and will send an error alert if any are found.</span></p>
<h3><span>Creating a testing environment</span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Building the pipeline processes is only one aspect of creating data pipelines; it’s an iterative process that might require you to make updates and changes depending on how technology or business needs change. Because you will want to continue making improvements to the system, you need to create ways to test any changes before they’re implemented to avoid disrupting users’ access to the data. This could include creating a separate staging environment for data where you can run tests or including a stable dataset that you can make changes to and compare to current processes without interrupting the current flow.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Dynamic dashboards</span></h2>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Dashboards are powerful visual tools that help BI professionals empower stakeholders with data insights they can access and use when they need them. Dashboards track, analyze, and visualize data in order to answer questions and solve problems. The following table summarizes how BI professionals approach dashboards and how it differs from their stakeholders:</span></p>

</table>
</div>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Note that new data is pulled into dashboards automatically only if the data structure remains the same. If the data structure is different or altered, you will have to update the dashboard design before the data is automatically updated in your dashboard.</span></p>
<h3><span>Dashboards are part of a business journey</span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Just like how the dashboard on an airplane shows the pilot their flight path, your dashboard does the same for your stakeholders. It helps them navigate the path of the project inside the data. If you add clear markers and highlight important points on your dashboard, users will understand where your data story is headed. Then, you can work together to make sure the business gets where it needs to go. To learn more about designing dashboards, check out this reading from the Google Data Analytics Certificate: </span><span><a class=""css-gcjbqe"" href=""https://www.coursera.org/learn/ask-questions-make-decisions/supplement/Jvsne/designing-compelling-dashboards"" target=""_blank"">Designing compelling dashboards</a></span><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Effective visualizations</span></h2>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Data visualizations are a key part of most dashboards, so you’ll want to ensure that you are creating effective visualizations. This requires organizing your thoughts using frameworks, incorporating key design principles, and ensuring you are avoiding misleading or inaccurate data visualizations by following best practices.</span></p>
<h3><span>Frameworks for organizing your thoughts about visualization</span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Frameworks can help you organize your thoughts about data visualization and give you a useful checklist to reference. Here are two frameworks that may be useful for you as you create your own data visualizations:&nbsp;</span></p>

</li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Pre-attentive attributes: marks and channels</span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Creating effective visuals involves considering how the brain works, then using specific visual elements to communicate the information effectively. Pre-attentive attributes are the elements of a data visualization that people recognize automatically without conscious effort. The essential, basic building blocks that make visuals immediately understandable are called marks and channels.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Design principles</span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>Once you understand the pre-attentive attributes of data visualization, you can go on to design principles for creating effective visuals. These design principles are vital to your work as a data analyst because they help you make sure that you are creating visualizations that convey your data effectively to your audience. By keeping these rules in mind, you can plan and evaluate your data visualizations to decide if they are working for you and your goals. And, if they aren’t, you can adjust them!&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Avoiding misleading or deceptive charts&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p data-text-variant=""body1""><span>As you have been learning, BI provides people with insights and knowledge they can use to make decisions.

<li>First, write down a function. This function can include any combination of polynomials, trigonometric functions, and exponents.</li>
<li>Then, pass your function to your neighbor. Your neighbor on the other side with pass their function to you.</li>
<li>Now everyone will differentiate the function in front of them. Fun times!</li>
<li>Once everyone is finished, pass your result along in the same direction. I will announce whether the function you receive needs to be differentiated or integrated.</li>
