<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Comprehensive Project</strong></span></p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to get you familiar with a 10k. (Remember that every public company is required to file a 10k on an annual basis with the SEC.) Before you get started, let's outline the <span style=""background-color: #fbeeb8;""><strong>requirements:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Your paper should be greater than <strong><span style=""background-color: #fbeeb8;"">3 pages</span></strong>
</li>
<li>Organize your paper according to the numbers shown below, meaning ""1. provide your answer"" go to the next line, ""2. provide your answer"" and so on. I want to be able to quickly find where you answered each of the 10 questions.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Please do <strong><span style=""background-color: #fbeeb8;"">NOT</span> </strong>copy the questions into your report. I already know what they are. :)</li>
<li>Please do <strong><span style=""background-color: #fbeeb8;"">NOT</span> </strong>copy and paste information in from the annual report.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Please keep your <span style=""background-color: #fbeeb8;""><strong>margins to </strong><strong><span style=""background-color: #fbeeb8;"">1""</span> </strong></span>and your <span style=""background-color: #fbeeb8;""><strong>spacing to 1.5</strong></span> (please no double spacing)</li>
<li>Use <span style=""background-color: #fbeeb8;""><strong>Calibri 12 point</strong></span> font</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Step 1</strong></span>: The following video will walk you through how to choose a company, use the Edgar database, and provide some hints on completing the assignment.</p>
<p><iframe style=""width: 608px; height: 402px;"" title=""Comprehensive Project Overview (05:00)"" src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/559489/external_tools/retrieve?display=borderless&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2F1832361.kaf.kaltura.com%2Fbrowseandembed%2Findex%2Fmedia%2Fentryid%2F1_ycvv4vul%2FshowDescription%2Ffalse%2FshowTitle%2Ffalse%2FshowTags%2Ffalse%2FshowDuration%2Ffalse%2FshowOwner%2Ffalse%2FshowUploadDate%2Ffalse%2FplayerSize%2F608x402%2FplayerSkin%2F26726461%2F"" width=""608"" height=""402"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"" webkitallowfullscreen=""webkitallowfullscreen"" mozallowfullscreen=""mozallowfullscreen"" allow=""geolocation *; microphone *; camera *; midi *; encrypted-media *; autoplay *""></iframe></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Step 2: </strong></span>Choose the company you will be analyzing. If you already have one in mind, jump to step 3. If you don't have a company in mind, select a company from the following list of companies: <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""https://fortune.com/fortune500/"" target=""_blank"">Fortune 500</a>. (If this link does not work, do a search for the top 100 companies in the United States.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Tip: </strong>Avoid choosing a company in one of the following industries: (1) Financial services (like a bank), (2) Insurance, and (3) Oil and Gas.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Step 3</strong></span>: Next locate the company 10-K annual report using the <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search-and-access"" target=""_blank"">EDGAR database</a>.&nbsp; If you aren't sure how to do this, please watch the video above. :)</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Step 4</strong></span>: Using the annual report, and thinking like a potential investor, please respond to the following questions <span style=""background-color: #fbeeb8;""><strong>(remember the writing rules above)</strong></span>:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Locate the consolidated statement of operations/earnings/income. Which accounts are you least familiar with? Scroll down to the footnotes (shown just below the financial statements) and see if you can find a footnote that talks about these accounts you identified. (It would be in the first 3-4 pages of the footnotes.) What did you learn? Now look at all the numbers on the income statement, has anything changed significantly over the last few years? What would be a reason for the change?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Locate the consolidated balance sheet/statement of position. Which accounts are you least familiar with? Scroll down to the footnotes (shown just below the financial statements) and see if you can find a footnote that talks about these accounts you identified. (It would be in the first 3-4 pages of the footnotes.) What did you learn? Now look at all the numbers on the balance sheet, has anything changed significantly over the last few years? What would be a reason for the change?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Compute 3 different ratios for two years, this way you can see the change in the ratio from year-to-year. What does each ratio tell you about the company? Was there a significant change between the years? Why do you think that change occurred?</li>
<li>Locate the 10-K of a competitor and run the same 3 ratios on this competitor. (The ratios on the competitor can be for just one year.) How is your chosen company doing when compared to their competitor? Were you surprised by any of the results? Why?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Scroll through the footnotes and find two of them that are interesting. Describe what is in this footnote. What did you learn? Would this information help you make a better decision about the company? If you could talk to the someone from the company, what additional questions would you ask them about the footnotes you read?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Considering the managerial accounting topics that we learned in this class, what kinds of product or service decisions do you think that your company would have to face? (Think about make vs. buy, add vs. drop, buying equipment/building using NPV or IRR, etc) Who should be making these types of decisions? How quickly should these decisions be made? Why?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Think about the module on budgeting. What would be the benefits of seeing the company's budgets for production, materials, cash, etc.? Right now this information is not provided in the annual report. Is it important enough to require companies to provide the budget information? Why</li>
<li>Do a search for recent news about this company and its management team. What did you learn?&nbsp;Would any of this news change your willingness to invest in this company?</li>
<li>If you could sit down with the CEO, CFO, CIO, COO, CMO, etc. what 3 business questions would you ask? Also, what one question would you ask purely out of interest/for fun?&nbsp;</li>
<li>If you were given $100,000 to invest in a publicly traded company, would you choose the company that you analyzed, why or why not?</li>
<li>What would be the value of choosing a different company and going through steps 1-5 again? How could an activity like this comprehensive project prepare you for your chosen profession?&nbsp;</li>

<p>I ask you to please complete the Student Ratings of Instruction (SRI) carefully and thoughtfully. The SRIs provide me with your direct feedback about what is working well and what could be improved in the course and with regard to my teaching, specifically. I use this feedback to set annual teaching goals and to make improvements to the course. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you complete this instrument:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want to hear from <em>everyone</em> to better understand your many different perspectives</li>
<li>The feedback on the SRI is anonymous, so you can feel free to be honest but also please be constructive.</li>
<li>This feedback comes straight to me and is also available to my department chair and dean.</li>
<li>It is most helpful if you provide specific feedback—e.g., “The instructions regarding how to complete X assignment need some clarification, as I struggled to understand some of the formatting requirements” instead of “Unclear expectations.”</li>
<li>Please ensure that the feedback you are providing is for the right course :)</li>
</ol>
<p>I thank you in advance for taking the time to complete the SRI!</p>
<p>- <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>To get credit, complete the SRI and upload a screenshot of your receipt into this assignment</strong></span></p>
<p>** NOTE: You should get an email with a link to the survey. If you don't, you can also get access by going to myUVU. Click on the <strong>Students</strong>&nbsp;tab and select&nbsp;<strong>My Academics</strong>. You will see a link to&nbsp;<strong>Rate Your Instructor</strong>&nbsp;and when you click on that, it will take you to a list of your active registrations. Only the classes with open SRIs will have a link at the bottom of the course information for SRIs.</p>

<p><strong>What you need to do:</strong></p>
<p>-Read and analyze the assigned 10-K for 2 hours before class (focus on reading content related to the questions. If you have trouble finding where to look in the 10-K, use CTRL-F to search for the words you're looking for).</p>
<p>-Come to class on Wednesday, November 30th and work with your assigned group on the analysis of the 10-K.</p>
<p>-Come to class on Monday, December 5th and be ready to discuss your company's 10-K with the class (discussion will be focused on the questions in the assignment document, so focus on that to be prepared). You <strong>do not&nbsp;</strong>need to prepare a formal presentation. Just be ready to tell us about your company and answer my questions.</p>
<p><strong>How your grade will be determined:</strong></p>
<p>-Your preparation before coming to class on Wednesday, November 30th</p>
<p>-Your participation (and effort) in your group during class on Wednesday, November 30th</p>
<p>-Your participation (and effort) during the discussion during class on Monday, December 5th</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp; Proctorio Practice</h2>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>For this quick assignment, you will be</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">- setting up Proctorio&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">- becoming familiar with the program</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">- taking a practice quiz&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">YOU WILL NEED A BLANK SHEET OF PAPER WITH YOUR NAME WRITTEN ON IT FOR THIS PRACTICE QUIZ. Please have this next to you before you begin.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">You will also need some form of ID to enter the exam. (This will be a rare occurrence that this is required.)</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>What is Proctorio?</strong></span></p>
<p>Proctorio, is the online proctoring system that UVU is integrating into their online classes. It is used by schools like Harvard and Standford and is meant to assist student integrity and to help keep the playing field fair for all students enrolled in an online course.</p>
<p>This class is part of a pilot program to have it heavily integrated into the class. Most of our quizzes and assignments will have some level of integration with Proctorio this semester. It is super easy to use, and is easy to install but requires about 15-30 minutes of time to get it set up. I also recognize that it is an extra step and would so appreciate your feedback on it throughout the course as we test it out.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How to get Proctorio set-up</strong></p>
<p>I have attached UVU's student setup guide below and I have also included links to help give you more insight and information about the program, how to use it, and who to contact when it doesn't work (this happens sometimes). <em>Keep in mind that while we will be using Proctorio a lot, we will not be using all of the features. For example, you rarely will have to have your web camera or audio on! Because, weird.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>If you are really struggling with the set-up, you can click on the FAQ link below and you will be given an option to set up a live chat to have someone help you.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Once you have gotten it set up, you will be taking this practice quiz (it is SUPER easy, I promise :)) to make sure everything is working properly and you have an idea of how the program functions.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please do not attempt this practice quiz UNTIL you have set up Proctorio, otherwise, you will lose the points.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Items to make note of</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>-Proctorio MUST be used with a Google Chrome browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>-The level of rigidity (what you can and can't do while the program is running) will be different for each of the different assignments and quizzes. For example, some assignments will allow you to open up other browsers to do research or watch a video, while others will lock down that feature. You will want to make sure to really pay attention to the quiz information that Proctorio gives before you begin your specific assignments and quizzes. I have had students get locked out because they accidentally clicked on an outside tab or browser before without realizing that they were not allowed for that particular assignment. Be aware of what the requirements are so that doesn't happen to you.&nbsp;</li>
<li>-It is your responsibility to install the program on your computer, get it set up, and troubleshoot. Just like it is your responsibility to have access to a working and capable computer for an online class.&nbsp;</li>
<li>-Once you begin an assignment/quiz/exam in Proctorio, the timer will start running, even if you click out of the exam and stop Proctorio from running. Most assignments will have 480 minutes to submit (8 hours) and you can reenter to work on them. However, that means that your assignment needs to be submitted before that 8 hours is up. After that, it will lock you out. Most quizzes and exams need to be completed in one sitting. This is something that you will be notified of before you begin the assignment/quiz/exam. Make sure to pay attention to the instructions that I and Proctorio give so you are fully aware of what is expected.&nbsp;</li>
<li>-When a student signs into a <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>test</strong></span>, Proctorio will require that they look into the web camera with sufficient clarity that their eye movements can be tracked. Glasses inhibit the recognition process and should be removed during the verification process. Once they are cleared by Proctorio they can put their glasses back on to take the test. We will rarely use the eye movement or web camera functions with the exceptions of the exams and a few other quizzes. This practice quiz is one of those exceptions.&nbsp;</li>
<li>- Again, to reiterate most of our quizzes and assignments DO NOT require that the web camera or audio is on. I would hate that as a student, and so I have tried to limit the web camera/audio requirements as much as possible. Usually, we are just using the program as an anti-plagiarism tool.&nbsp;</li>
<li>- Sometimes, and this makes no sense to me, but <em>Proctorio will require a code to access the program</em>. Very rarely, the program will glitch and will not show the code to the student - <strong>SO ANNOYING</strong>! <strong>I<em>f this happens</em></strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>1). Let me know so I can track it (remember we are testing this level of use of Proctorio for this class).</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>2) Then you need to reach out via <a class=""instructure_file_link inline_disabled"" href=""https://proctorio.com/support"" target=""_blank"">live chat</a> and they can give it to you and let you in</em></strong>.</p>
<p>I apologize in advance if this happens to you. Just know that it isn't totally out of the realm of reality and it isn't anything that you are doing wrong. Technology can be great sometimes, but it can also be a massive headache as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>&nbsp; Watch, Read, and Submit</h3>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Can art change the world? Or at the very least, impact it?&nbsp;</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">In this module, we were introduced to the power and significance of art. From prehistoric handprints on cave walls to artworks heralded as priceless masterpieces, art and visual culture can be a powerful method of communication. However, does it have the power to change the world, or to redirect a society or movement? For this assignment, you are asked to explore the work of street artists JR and Banksy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>NOTE: The links for the assignment are embedded in the questions. You will need to start the assignment or click ""take the quiz"" in order to access them. </em></span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>First</strong>, start off by reading the following Smithsonian Magazine Article on the elusive, yet ridiculously famous and wealthy graffiti artist Banksy. Then answer the corresponding questions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Second</strong>, you will watch a Ted Talk by JR titled: One Year of Turning the World Inside Out. Then answer the corresponding questions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Third</strong>, you will participate in a classwide discussion (On the next page Module 1 Assignment - Part 2) and need to...&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">1). <em>Critically and analytically assess if </em>a<em>rt can have a lasting or massive impact and how.</em></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">2).<em> Creatively consider and elaborate, if you had the mode and means, what cause or problem would you bring awareness to in regards to street art and how?&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>&nbsp; Discuss</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">For this assignment, you will contribute your thoughts to a group discussion both on art as a whole as well as on the street art of JR and Banksy.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Directions: <strong>Discuss your</strong> personal <strong>response</strong> and feelings <strong>to the</strong> <strong>following questions below</strong>. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>Then <strong>read and comment on the two students in front of your response</strong>.</em></span> If you are the first student to comment, you will comment on my response as well as on any other random student you choose at a later time in the week. If you are the second student to respond, comment on the student above you as well as on mine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Each of your own answers should be at least 3-4 sentences long, make sure you explain your answers. Be as descriptive as possible; avoid generalizations. <span>The whole purpose of this assignment is to help us <em>get to know you a little better</em> as well as to <em>contribute to the Module 1 Assignment - Part 1</em>. Your<span> answers should be a reflection of who you are, what you think about art, and how you would participate in street art movements if you had the mode and means. Answer the questions as honestly and thoroughly as you can, and you will receive full points. </span>The grading for this assignment is based on a complete vs. incomplete basis. To help you get to know me just a little bit better, my answers are below.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">What has been your exposure to art?<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">What do you think about art as a whole? Is it beneficial to society?<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Have you ever created a piece of art? Why or why not?<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">What are you most interested in learning from this class?<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Critically and analytically assess if art can have a lasting or massive impact and how. Use at least two specific examples from JR and Banksy (Make sure your first example is a Banksy example and the second is JR.)<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Creatively consider and elaborate, if you had the mode and means, what cause or problem would you bring awareness to in regards to street art and how? Would you participate with graffiti-like Banksy or would you participate in JR's Inside Out Project? What would be your purpose? Would cause would you bring awareness to or what statement would you make? How and where would you paste or put your work of art? Be mindful and seriously consider what you would do.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Answers. (NOTE: I have chosen examples from both JR and Bansky that were not discussed in the article or video.)&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What has been your exposure to art?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">So, I am the world's WORST artist. My students always make fun of me because I can't even draw a solid circle. I wasn't really exposed as a child, I don't even think I took an art class in junior high. It wasn't until high school that I really gained an interest. Since then, studying art is kind of what we do as a family. My mom and I even took art history courses together just for fun when I was in college (hello, nerd alert!). Now, it is my living and passion. I am currently engaged in my graduate degree, I can not get enough. (That being said, I totally understand that this is a 1010 course and I so do not expect everyone to feel the same way that I do. What is so fun about life is that everyone has different passions. I just want you to be successful and have an enjoyable experience). </span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>2. What do you think about art as a whole? Is it beneficial to society?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/degrassi/images/7/76/Kelly-kapoor-leaving-the-office.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130322183320"" alt="""" width=""150"" height=""150"">To quote Kelly Kapoor from the office "" UHHMAZZING"".&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">I always loved history and when I took AP Art History I was seriously hooked. I was fascinated by the ability that humans have to create</span> <span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">something that can serve so many different purposes - psychological, historical, sentimental, sensual etc. Since then, I have had the opportunity to see and study art all over the world. I love&nbsp;being able to learn more about a culture, people, and place through art. It gives a glimpse into the past and current human condition. To me, art is a universal characteristic - it spans time and place.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Do I think art is beneficial to society? Yes and no. Art is incredibly persuasive, it can persuade a culture, a people, religion, and even personal mood and feeling. Humans have the power through art to incite thoughts, revolutions, beliefs, emotions, and ideas. To me, it is more dependent on who is using the power of art and what they are doing with it. Art used by totalitarian governments is/was extremely powerful but I don't think it beneficial. However, art is often used as a way to promote discussion and dialogue, and that, I believe, is beyond beneficial. </span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>3. Have you ever created a piece of art? Why or why not?</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Believe it or not, YES! However, my first real work of art was a totally abstract painting piece that was an experiment I did with my then-toddler. It has NO artistic principles or elements involved whatsoever. Since then I have painted occasionally and have several abstract pieces in my home. I am getting better, but it is not really my talent. I just enjoy throwing paint at a canvas sometimes haha.</span></p>
<p><strong>4. What are you most interested in learning from this class?</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">I am most interested in you guys! It is so interesting having an online class because I create this quasi-relationships with my students. But, I love getting to know you through your comments, assignments, and thoughts. I know many of you are just knocking off a credit that you need to take and so I try to keep the coursework relatively doable and again, it is my hope that this is an enjoyable experience and you are successful in this course. Cheers!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>5. <span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Critically and analytically assess if art can have a lasting or massive impact and how. Use at least two specific examples from JR and Banksy (Make sure your first example is a Banksy example and the second is JR.)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Without a doubt, art can have a lasting impact. Consider propaganda and political or religious visual culture. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">What I love about Banksy is that he is such a loose cannon. Since he is so elusive, his artistic statements are uninhibited. Recently, I was so dumbfounded that when a small piece of his was up for auction. Within this particular piece, he had secretly built it in a self-destructing frame years earlier unbeknownst to the auction house.&nbsp; When the piece sold for 1.4 million dollars, right then and there it starts shredding into pieces as an alarm rang out. WHAT A FREAKING BOSS. I love his statement that art should be for everyone and not just for the elite. However, his estimated worth is over 50 million dollars, so he is such an enigma. Two years later</span> <span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">it is one of the most controversial art moments in recent history, and I think that it will be talked about and analyzed for decades. It brought awareness to class systems and social and economic issues in regards to access to art. If you want to know more, you can see the New York Times article <a class=""instructure_file_link inline_disabled"" href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/arts/design/uk-banksy-painting-sothebys.html#:~:text=LONDON%20%E2%80%94%20The%20British%20street%20artist,for%20%241.4%20million%20at%20auction."" target=""_blank"">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">The thing that I love most about JR is that his Inside Out Project is for everyone. I find it so inspiring that 20% of participants are from students in schools. When I was teaching at Alpine School District, I had my AP students actually participate in the program itself. It was so fun to see what they came up with. One of my favorite projects was a group of football players who decided to showcase and bring awareness to the special needs students at the school who were often overlooked. The scheduled interviews with each individual student in the special needs program, got parent permission, and then took the portraits themselves. It was something unique and I appreciated that the art project helped a group of teenagers look outside themselves. Looking outside ourselves is something that I think the world needs more of.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">6. Creatively consider and elaborate, if you had the mode and means, what cause or problem would you bring awareness to in regards to street art and how? Would you participate with graffiti-like Banksy or would you participate in JR's Inside Out Project? What would be your purpose? Would cause would you bring awareness to or what statement would you make? How and where would you paste or put your work of art? Be mindful and seriously consider what you would do.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the last several years, I have been doing research on fair trade, global child labor laws, and companies with a clean downline. It became really important to me that I was wearing and supporting businesses that care about and take notice to have clean supply chains, even if it means things are more inexpensive or their items are less popular to the masses. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">In my research, I found that so many popular companies (<a class=""instructure_file_link inline_disabled"" href=""https://www.npr.org/2011/12/16/143859114/report-links-victorias-secret-with-child-labor"" target=""_blank"">Victoria's Secret</a> and <a class=""instructure_file_link inline_disabled"" href=""https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-students-arent-fighting-forever-21"" target=""_blank"">Forever 21</a> being big ones) have acknowledged using or having sweatshops, slave labor, or child labor in their supply chains (the above links have reports on both chains from NPR as well as the New Yorker) and the average consumer has no idea.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""> Forced labor and child labor is a massive problem globally. <a class=""instructure_file_link inline_disabled"" href=""https://www.unicef.org/protection/child-labour#:~:text=Nearly%201%20in%2010%20children%20across%20the%20globe%20(around%20152,in%20hazardous%20forms%20of%20work."" target=""_blank"">UNICEF estimates that 1 in 10 children or 152 million children globally has to take part in forced child labor</a>.&nbsp; This is sickening for obvious reasons. As a mother, who also believes that education is one of the most important things for children and should be a right for all, I really struggle with these brands who deny these rights and mistreat impoverished people and children, especially for the means of profit.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">If I were to participate in JR's Inside Out Program, assuming I had the mode and means, I would take portraits of some of the children who are forced to work in these factories and I would paste them outside the flagship shops of some of the bigger retailers with these supply chain issues. I really believe that most people just don't know or consider that when they are buying a 5 dollar t-shirt from Forever 21 or even a 50 dollar set of lingerie that they are inadvertently supporting these brands with sketchy pasts and supply chains and thus child labor issues. This would be done in an attempt to educate and inform people that their purchases matter.&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>Choose the BEST answer and really consider what fundamentals are being used and where. You could easily B.S. almost any work or part of a work and say ""there is space and color here"". BUT we need to dig deeper and look at the why and the intention of the fundamentals. Vermeer was very specific in his composition, be specific in your choices and answers, and select what best fits.&nbsp;<br><br></span></li>
<li><span>&nbsp;Carefully watch the video as well as apply what you learned from the module. Make sure to have read each of the individual pages in the module. This will help you a lot as they each over the different fundamentals. It would also be helpful to have some quick notes nearby on each of the fundamentals, as you are going through this assignment. This will help keep the different aspects of each of the fundamentals clear.<br><br></span></li>

<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Description:</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">When studying art history, it can be very helpful to map out visual characteristics and advancements, so that you can see the big picture, rather than just individual details. For this assignment, you will create a style chart relating to the three periods covered in the module: 1) Prehistoric, 2) Mesopotamian, and 3) Egyptian. This comparative chart will also help you to prepare for the midterm and final exams. You will also be given the chance to create a similar style chart for each module which can culminate in 35 extra credit points at the end of the course. See the Style Chart Extra Credit Page in this Module for more info. Then you will do a self-assessment to receive your points.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Assignment Part 1: Module 4 Style Chart</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Create a chart based on the breakdown below. Your chart doesn’t have to look exactly like this (you may use a creative format, including color coding, etc.), but it should contain the same breakdown of information. <strong>You need to make sure that you use information PRIMARILY from the modules. You can use the internet to help you get some insight but all of the information you need for this assignment comes directly from Module 4.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Assignment Part 2: Self Assessment Quiz</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Since you hopefully will be creating a new chart from each module for extra credit, I want YOU to grade your own chart on thoroughness and information to have some autonomy. (I will be double-checking your submission for accuracy.) You will be grading yourself. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">To be able to receive the points, you must submit your assignment on time and you MUST make sure to follow the minimum requirements on the rubric and in the outline below. Although, you may be as detailed as you would like (there is no limit on length).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Once, you complete the quiz and I have gone through and double-checked your submission, the points will populate into your grade book. (Note: I have never had a student give themselves points they haven't deserved, but I will be checking your submission so just keep that in mind. Don't be the student who gives themselves points they don't deserve.) Please email me if you have any questions :).&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>&nbsp;Assess, Guess, &amp; Submit</h2>
<p>Whew! This module was beefy! So cheers to you for getting through it and learning about the major styles, movements, and artists within the Renaissance. The Renaissance is arguably one of the most important stylistic movements in an art historical context. The Renaissance changed everything and started a boom in artistic thought. It was to art, what the tech boom in the '90s was to technology today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help simplify and to help you better understand and classify the different and distinct movements/artists of the Renaissance, your assignment for this module is a guessing game. One in which you will be given works of art from the Renaissance that were not discussed in the module (I might have snuck a few well-known ones in there to give you a little break) and you will guess where the place (Italian versus Northern), the movement (Proto, Early, High Renaissance), and/or the artist (da Vinci, van Eyck, etc..).&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can have as many written notes as you would like for this assignment but your computer and internet will be totally locked down to keep the guessing game fair. I highly suggest filling out the style chart for this module. Not only will it help you slay this assignment but you will also be able to receive E.C. for it at the end of the semester. The winners of the game (whoever is able to score a perfect score or the three students with the highest score in the class) get an additional 10 points extra credit added to their final grade. This will be announced the Monday after the assignment is due.</p>
<p><strong>A quick note:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes I have classes where several students receive a perfect score. In this case, all get the extra 10 points. Sometimes no-one receives a perfect score but gets close. If this is the case, the students who get the three highest scores will get 10 extra credit points. In the event of ties, I will take the three highest scores and whoever has received a score within those three will receive the additional points. For example, if the three highest scores were 99.5, 99, and 98.5 any student that received those scores, even if they are tied, will receive the extra 10 points.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other information about this game:</strong></p>
<p>- This will be monitored by Proctorio and your computer and other tabs will be totally locked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- You will only have <strong>TWO</strong> attempts. So check, and double-check your answers to make sure you answered each one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Your attempt will need to be finished within 40 minutes of starting it. (The game itself shouldn't take that long, this assignment is more about the prep work ahead of time. But I wanted to give enough time just in case the image loading is slow etc..)&nbsp;</p>
<p>-If you submit the game late, but you receive perfect points, you will receive your perfect score for this assignment but will not get the extra points added on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GOOD LUCK!&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;We have spent this entire module focusing on the “power of imagery.” Following the French Revolution, Napoléon Bonaparte was a man with an undeniable penchant for propaganda, persuasion, and power. In this assignment, you will have the opportunity of evaluating how the self-proclaimed Emperor of France used imagery. This assignment is a continuation of our Module 5 Assignment when we looked at propaganda from the Roman Empire. However, this time we will be studying how Napoleon used similar imagery and ideology as part of his conquests and self-promotion.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Directions:</strong></span></p>
<p>Watch, or read the linked resources to follow, and answer the associated questions.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>three-part</strong> assignment. Please make sure to do ALL three parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Do images really hold power?</strong></p>
<p>For the second section of this assignment, really assess how you think imagery or visuals have power. Use at least one work from this module <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em><strong>and</strong></em></span> one personal experience with imagery to explain, in essay form, your understanding of visual propaganda and persuasion. Your final submission should be more formal in tone and should range from 3-5 paragraphs. Your personal experience example could be religious imagery, something that you see in social media, a sports-based logo, political imagery, or even something that you encounter in your workplace or your perspective career.</p>
<p>Be sure in your essay, that you <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">include the images</span> that you are using from the module and your personal example. Be aware, that we encounter visual-culture and persuasive symbols every day, and even though propaganda sounds negative, it isn't always the case. Almost every image that we process has some sort of effect on who we are, and how we view things for good or for bad.&nbsp; Some examples that students have used before are...&nbsp;</p>

<h2>&nbsp; Prepare</h2>
<p>As we are nearing the end of the course, that means Final Comparative Critique time. The Final Critique can be beastly (you have to individually critique and then cross critique two different works of art), so I like to try and give you some time to start preparing now. For this week's assignment, you will be given an opportunity to start your critiquing process by choosing ONE work of art from ONE of the styles listed below that we have studied this module. You will then use&nbsp;this as part of your submission for your Final Comparative Critique.</p>
<p>We are going to revisit the Feldman Method for critiquing art that we studied in Module 3. If you need to review the Feldman Method, please&nbsp;see&nbsp;<a href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/522614/pages/3-dot-7-the-feldman-method"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/522614/pages/3-dot-7-the-feldman-method"" data-api-returntype=""Page"">3.7 The Feldman Method</a>.</p>
<p>You will select <strong>one</strong> work of art from <strong>one of the styles</strong> given below from the Google Arts and Culture curated works that we have studied this Module. (To clarify, for your Final Critique you will be writing and comparing on TWO pieces but for this assignment, you will only be critiquing one.)</p>
<p><strong>You may select almost any work of art from these styles except for the MAJOR works - think <em>Starry Starry Night</em> by van Gogh. I don't want you picking a piece that already has miles of research/criticism on it. If you are not sure if your piece is too well known you can email me.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>The Assignment:</strong></span></p>
<p>For this critique, you will be critiquing one work of art, using the Feldman Method. Format your paper with double spacing, 12 point Times New Roman font and 1” margins. Use the terminology learned throughout the course, including the elements of art and the principles of design, as well as terminology and analysis learned throughout the historical sections of the course. Make sure to include<span>&nbsp;an&nbsp;</span><span><em>image&nbsp;</em></span>of the piece you are discussing, the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>name</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of your works, the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>artist</em>, the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>style</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>date</em><span>, </span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>medium</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the critique outline given in Module 3, and save your critique in one of the following formats: doc,<span>&nbsp;</span>docx, pdf.&nbsp; Attach your file and click submit.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>TO GET STARTED:</strong></p>
<p><span>Visit the following Google Arts online collections below. Select one artistic style&nbsp;and pick ONE piece to discuss and compare.&nbsp;<strong>Make sure to include the images of the piece chosen in your submission.&nbsp;</strong><br>Style selections: (you only need to select one)</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>TO RECEIVE POINTS:</strong></span></p>
<p>Because&nbsp;I will be doing a formal grade of your Final Comparative&nbsp;Critique at the end of the course, you will receive&nbsp;points on this assignment&nbsp;<strong><em>by simply participating and submitting what you have been working on</em>.</strong></p>
<p>-If your critique for this week is complete, that is fantastic because that means you are a third of the way done for your Final Comparative Critique and I will be so proud. GO YOU!</p>
<p>-If you only are able to submit what the work of art is that you will be critiquing and a couple of notes, that is also better than nothing, and you will still receive full points for this assignment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-If you DO NOT have anything to show for your work this week and you do not have a submission you will <strong>not</strong> receive points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, please be aware that I am giving full autonomy here and expect you to use your time wisely. Like I mentioned before, the Final Critique is the most difficult assignment of the course and is the most heavily weighted (it is my most favorite to grade! I LOVE seeing your progress). If you start working on the first part now, you will be all the more prepared and will have a third of your final critique done.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>Is Instagram an Art Form? Are Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and other social media channels reinventing or destroying ""art""?</strong></em></p>
<p>Now that we have gone through the major art movements and events in Western Society, we are going to dissect and address a current&nbsp;question in the art world - <em>How Does Social Media fit&nbsp;Into ""Art""?</em> Are social media feeds and images on social media artworks in and of themselves? Is social media beneficial to cultural progression or does it hinder it?</p>
<p>For our VERY last module assignment, (YAY!) you will use the same paradigm that we have been using when discussing artistic styles from ancient to modern times and you will be addressing how social media fits into art.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>The Assignment</strong></span></p>
<p>- <strong>Read</strong> at least THREE of the articles below (or you may find your own if you want - you just need to make sure you cite ALL of your information.) Make sure you cite what you use at the end of your argument.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- <strong>Decide</strong> where you stand on the argument and answer these questions. <em><strong>1) How do you feel social media fits into our modern cultural landscape? 2) Does social media require the use of artistic elements/principles? 3) Is social media a new form of ""art history"" for the millennial age? 4)What are the possible drawbacks or benefits from this?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>- <strong>Create</strong> a succinct 2-3 sentence thesis statement introducing your stance on the argument at the beginning of your essay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- <strong>Back up</strong> your thesis statement with 3-4 paragraphs arguing why you feel the way you do. Make sure your argument is rooted in research (the articles you choose) as well as personal experience and opinion.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> This assignment is not to be longer than a page. It is also not meant to take a major chunk&nbsp;of time, but rather help you to use some of the skills and information that we have been working on in this class and apply it something you encounter in your everyday lives, <em>which is social media</em>. I am not looking for a perfectly written and organized argument essay but want to know how you are able to apply art historical theory and context to&nbsp;a current social question.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Save your response in Microsoft Word (doc or docx) or PDF file format. Attach your file and submit the assignment.</span></p>

<h2>&nbsp; Extra Credit Submission</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">You can now submit all of your style charts for the course. These style charts can earn you up to a total of 35 points.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">To receive&nbsp;points for your style charts:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">-</span></strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Make sure you have taken all of the exams and submitted your critiques.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">-Please compile all of the style charts into ONE document. Submit that document.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">-In the text box on the left-hand side of the submission page, please tell me <strong>how many modules you have completed style charts for</strong>. Remember Module 4 does not count. Which means you could potentially have a total of 7 different style charts that you can submit for extra credit.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">WHAT ARE STYLE CHARTS</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">These charts are essentially note-taking guides and will GREATLY help you on your exam and critiques as they will break up the different movements and works we study. <strong>You will be able to use these style charts on the exams</strong> (even the proctored ones) and at the end of the course, for each style chart you have completed (excluding Module 4), you will be given up to 5 points extra credit <strong>which can result in a total of 35 points extra credit</strong> for the class. In order to receive the extra credit, exams must be completed and the formal critiques must be turned in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Your style charts will need to follow the similar criteria to Module 4. However, you can put information in and take out as you see fit (keep in mind that for the extra credit, your style charts need to be full. I am not expecting perfection AT ALL, but they do need to have relevant and pertinent information in them.)</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Style Chart Template:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">You can copy/paste the style chart template below and put it in a word or excel document to tailor your notes for each module. When we get to some of the later modules we will be covering many styles/movements per module so make sure to include them by adding on columns at the end. </span></p>

<p>WELCOME TO MODULE 1!&nbsp;</p>
<p>To receive points for this video assignment, watch the video (this one is a bit longer this week as we introduce visual culture as a whole) and then answer the corresponding questions in the survey below. You will want a spare sheet of paper and a pen out to record a few things as you watch.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/qgtiLY1EUAk"" width=""560"" height=""315"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: There is a slight ""trigger"" warning as this video will start the discussion of visual culture. I use some imagery that is currently floating around in our modern political and cultural landscape to begin this discussion. I also get a little personal in my discussion and share some of my own personal reactions. This is in no way meant to mean that if you do or don't feel the same way as I do that you are right or wrong. This exercise is simply one where we will examine what visual culture is and how images can affect us, and those around us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, one of these images has to do with the Confederate Flag. While the symbolism of the flag is not addressed in this video, (the main point in the video is for each of you to examine your own response to a few images that I show) I wanted to make sure to include an article from Professor Matthew Guterl of Brown University who is a Race and Nation Historian for anyone who wanted more information about the Confederate Flag. Today, especially in our political climate, the Confederate Flag is incredibly divisive. It is considered a symbol of hate, racism, oppression, and white supremacy today for many, and Prof. Guterl argues why it should no longer be used in any sort of political or cultural discourse, no matter what your political leanings may be.

<p><strong>Note 2</strong>: I discuss an iconographic transfer on a fairly well known Christian and LDS work of art replacing a child with a prominent pop-culture icon. I would like to correct that the iconographic transfer is between a lamb and the pop-culture icon, not a young child. I totally misspoke! These videos make me nervous sometimes, and I can totally get ahead of myself :).&nbsp;</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,10.0,['online_quiz'],1929556

<h2>&nbsp; Watch &amp; Answer</h2>
<p>Welcome to Module 2!&nbsp; Full disclosure, this is one of my least favorite modules, and the assignment is one of the trickier ones in terms of analysis. So, this video covers a lot and gives several answers to the quiz and the assignment to help you.&nbsp; These are the questions you will be asked to answer below to get your points for watching the video.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question 1: What did my kids do with my Winged Victory or Nike of Samothrace statue?</p>
<p>Question 2: Tile is used as a prop in this video. It is discussed that tile is always almost going to have what?</p>
<p>Question 3: I point out a very specific type of line when discussing the brand banner on the challenge butter. What type of line is it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question 4: Who is the artist of the work of art that is featured on the most missed question on the quiz?</p>
<p>Question 5: What are the expectations for this assignment?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question 6: Tell me about the National Gallery video.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question 7: Several answers are walked through and explained on the assignment for this module. What is the answer that is given for #7 on the Art of Painting piece?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Make sure you are familiar with the other Final Comparative Critique resources, and the information on the comparative critique before watching this. Doing so will help this clip be as useful to you as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This clip is almost 40 minutes long and is a little like an in-class lecture. It isn't something you have to finish in one sitting. If you can only watch a little bit here and then over the next day or two, that is okay. In this video I...</p>
<p>1) Walkthrough important tips&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Discuss how to use the resources you have</p>
<p>3) Give examples of how to best select your two pieces&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Discuss how to effectively research your pieces</p>
<p>5) Discuss the best way to write about your pieces and the things you want to focus on to get the highest grade</p>
<p>6) Discuss how to properly compare your two pieces&nbsp;</p>
<p>I try to break things down to make things as easy and simple for you as possible. You will receive 15 points toward your final end of term grade for watching this video. Then once the due date for this video assignment has passed, I will then go in and manually give you an additional 5 points extra credit points on top of that.</p>

<h2>&nbsp; Critique, Compare, and Submit</h2>
<div class=""event-detail-overflow"">
<p>For our last assignment, we are going to revisit the Feldman Method for critiquing art that we studied in Module 3. However, this time, instead of critiquing just one piece of art, you will be comparing and critiquing two. The purpose of this final comparative critique is to demonstrate how much you have learned over the course of the semester regarding the visual components of appreciating art. If you need to review the Feldman Method, please&nbsp;see:&nbsp;<a href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/522614/pages/3-dot-7-the-feldman-method"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/522614/pages/3-dot-7-the-feldman-method"" data-api-returntype=""Page"">3.7 The Feldman Method</a>.</p>
<p>You should have already started working on the first part of your critique in Module 9</p>
<p>For the rest of this assignment, you have two options.</p>
<p>For the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>first option,</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>you can go to an Art Museum of your choice here in the state of Utah and choose one different work found at that particular museum and complete the comparative critique on the works of your choice. See the list below to get an idea of the different art museums here in the state. If you choose this option, you will need to submit some sort of picture of you in the museum, a ticket, handout or stamp as proof of entrance to the museum with your assignment.</p>
<p>For the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>second option,</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>you can use the options given below from the Google Arts and Culture curated works and choose your second work from the remaining styles from any of the following selected styles below. (To clarify, you will be writing and comparing TWO pieces. One of these pieces should have already been selected back in Module 9.)</p>
<p><span><strong>The Assignment:</strong></span></p>
<p>For this comparative critique, you will be choosing two works as the subjects of a 1200 - 1600 word critique, using the Feldman Method. Format your paper with double spacing, 12 point Times New Roman font and 1” margins. Use the terminology learned throughout the course, including the elements of art and the principles of design, as well as terminology and analysis learned throughout the historical sections of the course. Make sure to include<span>&nbsp;</span><span><em>images</em></span><span>&nbsp;</span>of the pieces you are discussing, (either images you took or images found online) the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>names</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of each of your works, the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>artists</em>, the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>styles</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>dates</em>, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>mediums</em>.</p>
<p>YOU MUST ALSO CITE YOUR SOURCES</p>
<p>In your critique address each of the works<span>&nbsp;</span>separately using the Feldman Method first and<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>then compare</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>them following the same questioning process.</p>
<p>For example, when comparing make sure to address how the pieces compare and contrast as you describe them, analyze the different elements and principals employed, discuss the different interpretations and meanings found in each, and as you apply judgment to the pieces. Proofread before you submit your paper; make sure that it represents your best work and addresses the four-step Feldman Process.</p>
<p>Save your Critique in one of the following formats: doc,<span>&nbsp;</span>docx, pdf.&nbsp; Attach your file and click submit.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span><em>OPTION 1:</em></span></p>
<p><span>Visit one of the following museums in person and select your second work of art to critique and compare.&nbsp;<strong>Make sure to include proof of entrance as well as images of the pieces you are discussing.&nbsp;(</strong><strong>IF YOU HAVE NOT YET COMPLETED THE ASSIGNMENT FROM MODULE 9, PLEASE GO BACK AND PICK YOUR FIRST PIECE FROM ONE OF THE STYLES LISTED ON THE ASSIGNMENT PAGE)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Woodbury Art Museum<br>BYU Museum of Art<br>Utah Museum of Fine Arts<br>Springville Museum of Art<br>Utah Museum of Contemporary Art<br>Saint George Art Museum</span></p>
<p><span><em>OPTION 2</em>:</span></p>
<p><span>Visit the following Google Arts online collections below. Select your second work of art from the remaining styles below.&nbsp;<strong>Make sure to include the images of the pieces chosen in your submission.</strong><strong>&nbsp;(IF YOU HAVE NOT YET COMPLETED THE ASSIGNMENT FROM MODULE 9, PLEASE GO BACK AND PICK YOUR FIRST PIECE FROM ONE OF THE STYLES LISTED ON THE ASSIGNMENT PAGE AND THEN PICK YOU SECOND ONE HERE)</strong><br></span></p>

<li>What caused mass extinctions throughout the history of earth?&nbsp; Is mankind contributing to the next mass extinction on our planet?&nbsp; If so, how?&nbsp; How can we get involved to reverse the effects if they are there?</li>
<li>What invasive species are affecting life in Utah or another place in the USA? How and why do these invasive species alter an ecosystem and threaten it?&nbsp; (Use a specific invasive species to detail its effects such as the fungus that wiped out the American Chestnut Tree or the fungus that is currently affecting North American Bats.)&nbsp; What measures are being taken to counter the effect of invasive species?</li>
<li>What is a trophic cascade? How has your chosen ecosystem been affected by the destruction of the top predator?&nbsp; What measures have been taken to reverse the effect and have they been successful? (Two examples are the wolves in Yellowstone National Park and the whales and dolphins in the ocean.&nbsp; There are likely others you will come across as well. Both of these have YouTube videos to get you started. Netflix also has Seaspiracy.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>What are prion diseases? How are prions transmitted?&nbsp; What are the symptoms?&nbsp; What effect have prion diseases had on ecosystems and humans themselves? What can we do to eliminate prion diseases from our food supply?</li>
<li>What is sustainable farming? How is sustainable farming better for the environment than traditional farming?&nbsp; How can we as consumers help to promote sustainable farming?</li>
<li>What do we know about the effect of high fructose corn syrup on human health? Why and how is it produced?&nbsp; Should it be banned from consumer products?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Are sugar substitutes such as saccharin, sucralose, and aspartame healthy for humans? What effect do they have on weight loss or weight gain if any?&nbsp; Look into microbiome research to write your article on this one.</li>
<li>Sarah Rigby a journalist for BBC Science Focus Magazine, claims that researchers at the University of Florida have discovered bacterial species responsible for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Additionally, she claims that they have also discovered bacteria that counteract the effects of the “bad” microbes.&nbsp;&nbsp; What causes dysbiosis of the gut microbiota?&nbsp; How does this dysbiosis contribute to Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease?&nbsp; Does the data truly support this claim?&nbsp; How can you make sure your gut microbiota stays healthy to prevent these types of neurodegenerative diseases?</li>

We need to determine if bias is associated with the findings, for example, or was the research funding provided by an individual or a company seeking financial gain from a particular result.&nbsp; We must also determine if the study used controls, was repeated at least three times with the same results, used enough subjects to have significance, and was published in a peer-reviewed journal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this discussion board, choose one of the two scientific claims supported by flawed research and write one to two paragraphs explaining <strong>two flaws in the research</strong> (4pt) and how each flaw could have been addressed appropriately in the original study.&nbsp; For example, if the control group is missing explain an appropriate control that could have been used. (2pt) Secondly, explain why people still believe the claims even today though new research (using the scientific process appropriately) has revealed the flaws of the original study and refuted the results. (3 pt) Thirdly, share how your opinion about this claim changed before and after learning about the claim. (2pt) Use appropriate grammar, spelling, and punctuation. (1pt)&nbsp;</p>

Inheriting a damaged gene is not in our control, but many behaviors that can lead to cancer are. This discussion board is a place to share your understanding, stories, and feelings about cancer</p>
<p><strong>First </strong>- Read <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>either</strong></span></em> the article from the Deseret News on lung cancer caused by radon exposure or the article from the National Cancer Institute on Human Papilloma Virus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Third </strong>- Write an essay that includes the following:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Share how learning about cancer in general, or cancer caused by radon or HPV has changed your perspective on this topic. (10 points)&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; What behaviors of your own might you change as a result of this knowledge? (4 points)</p>
<p>3. Compare the experience of the breast cancer survivor to people in your life who have overcome or had cancer.&nbsp; Did the women in the article and the person in your life who had or overcame cancer feel the same way about cancer? (4pt)</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Did this article or the person you knew who overcame cancer change your view of cancer?&nbsp; &nbsp;If so how? (2 points)</p>

<li>The sequence on the next page shows the complementary base sequences in two strands of DNA. Polarity is also designated for each strand.&nbsp; If the upper strand is a “coding strand”, what does the lower strand represent? _____________________________________________________________________</li>
<li>If the sequence that is shown in capital letters represents the start of transcription, what role does the lower case sequence upstream of the capital letters provide to the gene?_____________________________________________________ (This is the sequence to which the enzyme that will make an RNA copy will bind to open the helix and begin transcription.)&nbsp;</li>
<li>The enzyme that will carry out transcription is called an _________________________.</li>
<li>Transcribe the rest of the mRNA using the lower strand as your mold for complementary base pairing to build the mRNA .&nbsp; Then use the codon chart on the back to translate the mRNA into a polypeptide.&nbsp; Translation begins at the AUG that encodes the first amino acid (M) in the mRNA. Translation ends at the __________ codon in the mRNA.</li>

But, while this assignment says that it is due on Feb. 7, earlier is better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below you will see a list with two columns.&nbsp; The first will be the Name of the Speaker (""Speaker"") and the second is the Name of the Reviewer (""Reviewer"").&nbsp; Just like the Joke speeches, I want you to go to the McGraw-Hill site for the speeches you recorded and find the person whom you are reviewing. The Reviewer will complete the attached form (see how easy that is?).</p>
<p>Once you have completed the form, you will submit it as ""Assignments: Same Old Bag Peer Reviews.""&nbsp; That form asks you how many points should be awarded to the Speaker.&nbsp; No, I don't feel obligated to give the number of points you recommended.&nbsp; Frankly, some of you have been pretty tough on each other! But I want your opinion.</p>
<p>This is an introductory speech so preparation was minimal. BUT, in the future, I am going to assign multiple reviewers to each speech.&nbsp; This is to help you get more input. I am giving you a few days to write the review and to submit it.&nbsp; And, yes, you get points for your reviews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another change in future speeches is this: you will contact the Speech Lab to review your speeches.&nbsp; As this was so short and does not require you to submit an outline, I didn't think it was worth the effort.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Final consists of three essays (50 points for each).&nbsp; They should be at least 1 page each (for a total of three), double-spaced, in 12-point type. Please answer the following:</p>
<p>1. In our class we did several speeches.&nbsp; Each had a different purpose, organization, structure, etc. Which was your favorite and which was your least favorite?</p>
<p>2. What did you learn or gain from this class?&nbsp; I am looking for what you considered to be the most valuable thing you picked up?&nbsp; And I am looking for what you thought was lame?</p>
<p>3. This may sound dumb, but I want to know what you considered your greatest failure and weakness?&nbsp; No, I am not looking for a confessional.&nbsp; I want to know how we can make this class better.</p>
<p>If you answer this fourth question, I will add 25 extra credit points to your score:</p>
<p>4. Has this class helped you in your educational journey? In short, is there anything that is going to be different in your life because you took it? If the answer is ""Heck NO!"" I will understand.&nbsp; (I have been hurt before!)</p>
<p>For full disclosure, I don't like online speech classes.&nbsp; You didn't get a chance to see each other, help each other, and get to know each other. This was not my decision (as I hope you know). The good news is that no one got sick and you got the points for this class to help you move through your education.&nbsp; I am a wonderful, charming, and modest person (can you tell?).&nbsp; I sincerely hope our paths cross again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need these essays by Wednesday night.&nbsp; Sorry, no late submissions.&nbsp;</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,150.0,"['online_text_entry', 'online_upload']",1929556

<ul>
<li>The topic needs to come from one of the content-based readings on policing and prisons we have done so far this semester (i.e., Alexander and Parenti).</li>
<li>The topic must be connected to social justice, as defined in “Social Justice and English 2010,” which we covered the first week of the semester.</li>
<li>The topic cannot be entirely historical—it has to have some contemporary relevance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have selected your topics, for each topic selected, type the following in the text box below:</p>
<p>1. Describe your topic briefly, and explain where you found it in the text, being as precise as you can (e.g., ""On page 412, first full paragraph . . ."").</p>
<p>2. Explain why you believe this topic fits the second two requirements from the assignment description: How is it connected to social justice? Does it have contemporary relevance? For some topics, you'll need to do more work to make your case that the topic meets these requirements.</p>
<p>When I'm evaluating your worksheets, I will give you feedback about the feasibility of each of your proposed topics, in order to help you decide which topic to focus on. I will also let you know if one or more of your topics will not work. <em>Note</em>: If you decided to go with a topic other than one of those listed here, you must resubmit this worksheet in order to receive feedback on the new topic.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">A reminder about how these worksheets function</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worksheets are mandatory---you must complete them before submitting the corresponding essay. As such, worksheets can be accepted late, with the accompanying penalty as described in the syllabus (a 7% deduction for each day the worksheet is late).</li>
<li>You may be asked to resubmit a worksheet that is incomplete or requires additional work. In such cases, you will receive a 0 grade on the first submission, but can still receive full points. You won't receive a late penalty as long as the original submission was made on time and you resubmit the worksheet in a timely&nbsp; way.</li>

You will not be penalized for turning this worksheet in late if you are waiting for my feedback on the previous worksheet and you submit this worksheet in a timely manner after receiving that feedback.</strong></p>
<p>1. In the first worksheet, you received feedback on 2-3 potential research topics. What topic have you selected?

<p>1. Briefly restate your chosen topic. You can copy and paste this from your previous worksheet.</p>
<p>2. List two sources you plan to use for the Project Proposal. These should both be sources found through the library databases. For each of these sources, provide the following details:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">a. A complete and correct MLA citation. You should obtain these citations using the database's citation feature. (You'll need to double-check the citations to make sure they are correct.)</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">b. A short (2-3 sentence) summary of the source.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">c. A brief description of how the source will be useful in helping you develop background knowledge on your topic.</p>
<p>3. A complete, detailed paragraph from your proposal. This paragraph should be 8-10 sentences long and should include plenty of details from one of the sources listed above, including plenty of short quotations and paraphrase, along with parenthetical (in-text) MLA citations.

To receive full points, your questions should meet the length requirement and also include plenty of details from the text, with in-text citations including page numbers.</p>
<p>1. As in previous chapters, Parenti makes some very bold claims in chapter ten. For example, he argues that rape is ""central to . . . the politics of incarceration"" (184), that ""rape almost seems like a central part of prison management"" (185) and that ""gangs, like rape, are an indispensable part of ruling America's captive populations"" (195). What evidence does Parenti use to support these claims? Does his use of this evidence convince you? Why or why not? Be as specific as you can, and refer to specific passages, using in-text citations.</p>
<p>2. What was your reaction to reading chapter 10? How did you respond to it on a logical and emotional way? How did Parenti utilize appeals to logic (logos) and pathos (emotion) to support his arguments? Spend some time thinking about the experiences of a prisoner who is impacted by the realities of rape and gang violence discussed by Parenti. How would you react if you, or one of your family members, was placed in such a situation?</p>
<p>3. You were assigned two additional readings this week that update and speak back to <em>Lockdown</em> <em>America---</em>articles by Daniel Bergner and Franklin Zimring. Spend some time comparing and contrasting these readings. How do these texts support the claims made by Parenti? How to they contradict Parenti's arguments? How do the new readings reveal the complexities and contradictions surrounding policing and prisons?</p>

Alexander tells us that&nbsp; she ""reached the conclusions presented in this book reluctantly"" (2), that she originally found the ""idea of a new racial caste system"" to be ""absurd"" (3), and she seems to be working to win over a reluctant reader as well. Does her argument seem controversial to you? Why or why not? Does she do a good job of defending her position?</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">b. What was your viewpoint on race and policing prior to reading this article? Did your point of view change? Did anything in particular about the article surprise you or make you re-examine formerly held perspectives?</p>
<p>3. Respond to the following questions concerning the selection from Parenti:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">a. As you will recall, you were asked to look up and document several historical and cultural references from this selection as part of the reading process and as preparation for this week's quiz. For this assignment, I'm asking you to extend that effort by spending more time doing background research on one of these historical or cultural topics. To avoid overlap, take the number for the month of your birth, and add three. For example, if you were born in March, you would add 3 + 3 for 6; if you were born in December, you would add 12 + 3 for 15. Then, go to the resulting page number (i.e., page 6 for those born in March) and select an unfamiliar historical term from that page. Your next job is to look up that topic in a reference work (perhaps <em>Funk and Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia</em> or Wikipedia), and describe the topic for your group members in a paragraph of at least 4-5 sentences. The aim of this task is to enrich the reading of all group members by providing some background research.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">b. Did this reading challenge your view of American history in any way? Did any of it surprise you? What was your perception of America in the 1960s and 70s before you read this chapter? What was your perception after you read it?</p>
<p>As you are discussing each text, please paraphrase or quote from specific passages, including parenthetical citations with page numbers. Format these citations the same way I did when I quoted from Alexander in question 2a.</p>
<p>4. Finally, briefly introduce yourself to your group members: What is your major? Do you have any interesting hobbies or interests? Do you have any pets? Can you think of an embarrassing incident you'd like to share? (You are also asked to send an e-mail to introduce yourself to the professor---you can copy and paste your response to this question to that e-mail.)</p>
<p>After you've made these original posts, a discussion should ensue among your group members. In this discussion, you should discuss the text with each other as if you were in a room together. You should make a minimum of ten posts, and you should respond at least once to each group member. At least half of these posts should be 50 or more words long. In order to allow flexibility for those who need it, these posts can be completed anytime before Tuesday, January 19 at 8:00 a.m. Of course, these forums will work best if you check back in a few times to read and respond to your group members.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Grading</span>:</p>
<p>10 points for each 100-word summary (20 points)</p>
<p>5 points for each question on Alexander and Parenti (20 points)</p>
<p>5 points for introducing yourself</p>
<p>15 points for detailed responses to your group members</p>
<p>60 points total</p>
<p><em>Important Note</em>: Critical thinking and exploring controversial topics from various perspectives are key elements of this course. As such, please maintain courtesy in discussion forums at all times. To do so, make sure that you present your experiences and viewpoints in a frank and honest way, but also keep in mind that some of your classmates may have very different experiences and viewpoints. You should always communicate with the assumption that some of the individuals reading your posts will differ from you in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sexual orientation</li>
<li>Gender identity and expression</li>
<li>Ethnicity, race, and/or national origin</li>
<li>Immigration status</li>
<li>Religious belief (or lack thereof)</li>
<li>Political affiliation and ideology</li>
<li>Social class</li>
</ul>
<p>This does not mean you can't express your personal views. It does mean that you need to explain your views within the context of your beliefs and experiences and do so in a way that won't make someone who has had (possibly very) different experiences and viewpoints feel unwelcome or out of place.</p>

<p>As I've indicated previously, you should think of your classmates as part of your audience for all of your papers in this class, and you will have the opportunity to read and respond to the writing of your classmates throughout the semester.</p>
<p>This forum plays a very different purpose than a peer review, and you shouldn't approach your responses in the way you would a peer review. The purpose here is to serve as an audience member, and to engage with your group members as a interlocutor, someone who is a part of the conversation on the topic chosen and who speaks back to the author.</p>
<p>You are required to respond to the posts of at least four group members. Please prioritize group members who have not received many responses yet.</p>
<p>One of the primary purposes of the Project Proposal is to make an argument as to why the chosen topic is worthy of consideration. Has the author of this proposal convinced you that their topic is worth your attention as a potential reader? How do they go about making this argument? Look at the specific evidence that they use. Why is that evidence convincing to you or not convincing to you? If you believe that this topic is not worthy of intensive consideration, explain why, backing it up with evidence from the text. Here you should be a critical reader of the text, approaching this proposal the same way you would a scholarly article or another text you encounter in a college class. Look at the claims being made as well as the specific, detailed evidence used to support those claims.</p>
<p>Your response to each group member should be at least 150 words. In response, make sure you briefly quote from and otherwise refer to specific parts of the text, within in-text citations, at least five times.</p>
<p>If you are turning your proposal in on time, you should submit your complete proposal to the forum by 1:00 a.m. on Thursday morning (Wednesday night). If your Project Proposal is not ready by the Wednesday deadline, you should submit a partial draft---as much as you have---by the end of the day on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your responses to group members should be completed by the end of the day on Saturday, February 27.</p>

<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Part 1</span>: Your original post, which should respond to each of the following questions in answers of at least 100 words each. This post is due by the end of the day on Thursday, January 28. Part 1 is worth 40 points---10 points for each question. To receive full points, your questions should meet the length requirement and also include plenty of details from the text, with in-text citations including page numbers.</p>
<p>1. As you read, SWAT stands for Special Weapons and Tactics (112). Think about the specific weapons and tactics that SWAT teams use, as described in chapter six. If you are unfamiliar with the weapons mentioned, look up one or two of them to gain a better understanding. Describe the specific weapon you researched, and also summarize or discuss one of the SWAT “tactics” Parenti describes. How would you feel if officers with these sorts of weapons, and using these sorts of tactics, were deployed in your neighborhood? How would you and your family members react?</p>
<p>2. In the later part of chapter six, Parenti makes some strong arguments. For example, he contends that “the whole discourse of law enforcement takes place within a larger context of increasingly racist, anti-poor demagogy” (132), that “military technology and training do not make people safer” (133), and that “ritualized displays of terror are built into American policing” (135, emphasis in original). As I always emphasize with my students, strong arguments should be supported with strong evidence. Are these claims justified and supported by Parenti’s evidence? Why or why not? Pick one of these examples to focus on and use details from the text (with in-text citations) to support your response.</p>
<p>3. What does Parenti believe are the causes for the buildup of incarceration in recent decades? (If necessary, review pp. 167-169). Do you agree with his assessment? Why or why not? If not, what causes do you believe led to this dramatic increase in the prison population? Use evidence from the text, with in-text citations including page numbers, to support your response.</p>
<p>4. Parenti describes some features of contemporary prisons in chapter nine, and some things that have been taken away from prisoners in the years before he wrote this book. What do you think of these changes? Should prison be like this? Do prisoners need things like weight-lifting equipment and law libraries? If you were in a position to establish public policy regrading prisons, what conveniences and “amenities” would you allow prisoners to have and what things would you prohibit?&nbsp;</p>

<p>This assignment is due on Wednesday, February 24. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The late due date is Monday, March 1</span>.</p>
<p>I treat the proposals as an opportunity for you to discuss the preliminary reading and thinking you have done around your topic, and to receive feedback. As such, one of the key elements I’ll be focusing on as I grade is the degree to which you show detailed and sustained engagement with your sources—something I’ve mentioned before, of course. The key to receiving an A grade for your proposal is convincing me that you’ve done your work, that you really understand the topic based upon preliminary reading from the 2-3 required sources.</p>
<p>In addition to this, you’ll be evaluated based upon making sure you cover all the bases for the proposal requirements, and doing so in a thoughtful way. In particular, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your topic fits the requirements in the assignment description and has been approved through the worksheet process.</li>
<li>Demonstrate adequate background knowledge on your topic.</li>
<li>Make an argument as to why the topic is important, why it is worthy of consideration, and why the reader should care.</li>
<li>Make sure you are citing your sources correctly, according to MLA requirements, both in the works cited page and with in-text citations.</li>
<li>Talk about ways that you are working to narrow your focus, or ways that you foresee narrowing your focus based upon your preliminary work to this point.</li>
<li>List and discuss your preliminary research questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, you should make sure you are using the required&nbsp;<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">library</span> sources, as discussed in the assignment description. You should also avoid web sources, except for one optional Wikipedia article. Make sure your sources are helping you gain strong background knowledge on your topic.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">In this activity, you will collect information about the potential earthquake hazards and vulnerability of where you live.&nbsp; If you do not live along the Wasatch Front, you can use UVU's location, or some other place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Factors that affect seismic risk include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><em>Hazard</em>: The chance that the building will experience strong shaking, soil liquefaction, or a landslide.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><em>Vulnerability</em>: The likelihood that the building will collapse due to those geological hazards.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>Follow these directions to collect your numbers for each index, and then input your information into the Google Sheet provided in the Module.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">First we will examine the physical geographic contexts of your location, then you will examine the dwelling&nbsp;itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Examine the Strong Shaking Potential map on Page 16 of the <em>Scenario for a Magnitude 7.0 Earthquake on the Wasatch Fault–Salt Lake City Segment </em>report (found on Canvas).&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">This is a map of the shaking intensity that is 10% likely to occur. Use the following categories to score the seismic hazard due to strong shaking. Score your location location using the numbers in parentheses, based on the ground acceleration. Put the score in the column labeled A on the seismic risk spreadsheet.</span>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Purple to blue to green areas of the map: Low hazard (1)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Yellow to Orange areas of the map: Moderate hazard (2)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Red areas of the map: Significant hazard (3)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Examine the Liquefaction Potential map from the Utah Geologic Survey (<a href=""https://geology.utah.gov/hazards/earthquakes-faults/liquefaction/#tab-id-2)"">https://geology.utah.gov/hazards/earthquakes-faults/liquefaction/#tab-id-2)</a>. This is a map of the likelihood of liquefaction due to earthquake shaking . Score your location using the numbers in parentheses, based on the liquefaction potential map. Put the score in the column labeled B on the seismic risk spreadsheet.</span>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><u>L</u>ow / <u>V</u>ery <u>L</u>ow hazard (1)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><u>M</u>oderate hazard (2)</span></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Examine the Landslide potential map of Page 21 of the <em>Scenario for a Magnitude 7.0 Earthquake on the Wasatch Fault–Salt Lake City Segment </em>(available here:&nbsp; <a href=""https://dem.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2015/03/RS1058_EERI_SLC_EQ_Scenario.pdf"">https://dem.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2015/03/RS1058_EERI_SLC_EQ_Scenario.pdf</a>).&nbsp; In this report you will find 2 maps—one of landslide potential in wet conditions and one in dry conditions. You will try to take the average between these two maps.&nbsp; Estimate the landslide hazard using the categories below. Score your location using the numbers in parentheses, based on the landslide hazard. Put the score in the column labeled C on the seismic risk spreadsheet. </span>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Low hazard: grey areas on map, on flat land (1)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Moderate hazard: green to yellow areas on the map, at foot of slope or on gradual slope (2)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">High hazard: orange to red areas on the map, building is on a steep slope (3)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Building construction plays a large role in determining risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Examine&nbsp;your house or dwelling and&nbsp;see if there are any “soft stories,” floors of the building with few supporting walls, such as parking garages or large auditoriums, that are underneath other floors of the building.</span>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">If there are Soft Stories, enter 1; if no soft stories, enter 0</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Buildings made of unreinforced masonry (brick or concrete without reinforcement) are particularly susceptible to earthquake damage. If there is clear evidence that a building is made of unreinforced masonry, that building gets a 2 in column C. If the building is made of masonry and it was built before 1970, give it a score of 1.5.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Buildings with a vertical irregularity (different parts at different heights) or plan irregularity (deviations from a box-shape) tend to fare poorly in earthquakes. Give each building with either type of irregularity a score of 0.5.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Number of people in the house/dwelling: The “value” we are using when calculating risk in this exercise is the number of lives at risk.&nbsp;If you live in a house, count the number of people that are regularly present.&nbsp; If you live in an apartment building or multi-dwelling unit, estimate the number of people in your particular building.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>After you have completed the tasks above, open the Google Sheet and add a new row with your information.&nbsp; The Google Sheet can be found here (<a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dMKkh_3yxAoG3EYlT9wVavgDQB7hIs7G8swQUodRZmY/edit?usp=sharing"">Earthquake risk assessment sheet</a>) and also on the Modules tab for this unit.&nbsp; Your risk will be automatically calculated once you enter in the information in the columns.&nbsp; The lower the number is the risk column, the better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">In your discussion, share your results.&nbsp; What was your risk score?&nbsp; What were some of the biggest contributing factors to your risk score?&nbsp; What</span> surprised you about earthquake risk in Utah?&nbsp;&nbsp;How could you reduce your earthquake risk?&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will also comment on two group members.&nbsp; Give a general reaction to their score and ask one question about their risk score that they did not discuss.&nbsp; For example, you might ask why their risk of landslides was high, or liquefaction low.&nbsp; Finally, help them think about ways to be prepared for an earthquake.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To gain an understanding of how really difficult making maps are, you will do an experiment in map making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this experiment, complete the following steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Get a round fruit with a peel, such an orange, grapefruit, cutie, tangerine, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Sketch out the earth on the fruit.&nbsp; Use a globe, or look at online images of a globe, to help you sketch your continents and oceans as good as possible.&nbsp; Your globe might look something like this:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/521679/files/106822917/download?verifier=CaZXaZsf0bCmV4qBKRKU4Vn19Zg9FpomreESfqMQ&amp;wrap=1"" alt=""orange map"" width=""395"" height=""207"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/521679/files/106822917"" data-api-returntype=""File""></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Once your fruit globe is complete, remove the peel as carefully as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>You can choose to make cuts or slices in the peel while you remove it.&nbsp; Read on to Step 4 for more help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>4.&nbsp; Once you have the peel, figure out how to make the peels fit onto a flat surface.&nbsp; Turn your globe into a map!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>You might try cutting shapes or lines in particular places to try to get your peel to lay flat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you have made the best map you can, take a picture of the orange peel map and post it to your discussion group.&nbsp; Along with the picture, write one paragraph on your experience of the experiment (what was easy?&nbsp; what was hard?&nbsp; how did it help you understand map projections?&nbsp; any other thoughts?).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>If you have lived in Utah during the winter, you have probably experienced or heard about the inversion. &nbsp;An inversion is not something that&nbsp;<em>creates</em>&nbsp;pollution, but something that&nbsp;<em>traps</em>&nbsp;pollution in a localized area.&nbsp; The “inversion” refers to a temperature inversion, where warm air above traps cold air at the surface (normally, warm air at the surface rises and cools, so cooler air is found above warm air).&nbsp; When the cold air at the surface is trapped, so is all of the particulate matter and pollution the air contains.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you need a reminder of the inversion and its impact on pollution, here is a short video from 2013, one of the worst years on record:<a class=""external youtubed"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdCm4PYyWxo"" target=""_blank"" data-ytt-failcnt=""1"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdCm4PYyWxo<span class=""screenreader-only"">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline"" title=""Links to an external site.""><span class=""screenreader-only"">Links to an external site.</span></span></a><a class=""youtubed"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdCm4PYyWxo""><img class=""media_comment_thumbnail"" src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/images/play_overlay.png"" alt=""""></a><br></span></p>
<p><span>For this assignment, you will examine different aspects of Utah’s air pollution and inversion.&nbsp; &nbsp;You will investigate and explain pollution along the Wasatch Front.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Utah Department of Air Quality can help you identify pollution issues:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class=""external"" href=""https://deq.utah.gov/division-air-quality"" target=""_blank"">https://deq.utah.gov/division-air-quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=""screenreader-only"">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline"" title=""Links to an external site.""><span class=""screenreader-only"">Links to an external site.</span></span></a></span><span>Open the DEQ site, and select the Interactive Map option at the top.&nbsp; Once you are in the map, click on the Air Quality section and select the item you want to examine, then click on the blue Search button on the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><strong>Source</strong>:&nbsp; what are&nbsp;some of the primary sources of pollution in the Wasatch Front?&nbsp; Pollution is grouped into two different categories:&nbsp; point and non-point.&nbsp; Review these definitions (here is a good website:&nbsp;<a class=""external"" href=""https://www.epa.gov/nps/basic-information-about-nonpoint-source-nps-pollution"" target=""_blank"">https://www.epa.gov/nps/basic-information-about-nonpoint-source-nps-pollution<span class=""screenreader-only"">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline"" title=""Links to an external site.""><span class=""screenreader-only"">Links to an external site.</span></span></a>), and then provide detailed examples in our local context.&nbsp; *For example, do not just list factories/power plants as point source pollution, but list exactly what factories or power plants and where they are located.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>A<strong>tmospheric Conditions and Topography</strong>:&nbsp; why are we in Utah prone to inversions?&nbsp; Explain our topography and atmospheric conditions that leave us vulnerable to these conditions.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>How to improve:&nbsp;</strong>Now that you have read about sources of pollution, think of 3 ideas that the State of Utah can implement to improve air quality issues.&nbsp; &nbsp;Describe your 3 ideas for our local area in your response here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>After you have posted, read the ideas presented by your classmates.&nbsp; Comment on at least two group members.&nbsp; In your comments, reflect on the sources of pollution they identified and evaluate their potential solutions.&nbsp; What are some of the challenges for implementation of their solutions?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Capitol Reef National Park </u></p>
<p>Did you know UVU has a Field Station in Capitol Reef National Park?&nbsp; It’s pretty amazing.&nbsp; For this first part of the assignment, you will discuss jointing, chemical weathering, and physical weathering that is visible in park.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>First, analyze the landscape formation processes in this image of the field station.&nbsp; What evidence of jointing, chemical weathering, and physical weathering are visible here?&nbsp; Write one paragraph.&nbsp;</li>

<p><u>Mass wasting and flash floods in Utah </u></p>
<p>Mass wasting and flash floods are very intense processes of landscape formation.&nbsp; Here, you will compare videos of flash floods and debris flowers in Utah.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>First, find a video of a flash flood in a canyon in Utah.&nbsp; Paste the link to the video here.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Next, find a video of a debris flow in Utah.&nbsp; Paste the link to the video here.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Compare and contrast these two events.&nbsp;

<p>For this assignment, you will examine this collection of videos of earth changes compiled by Google Earth.&nbsp; Google Earth uses satellite imagery, and through their time lapse and historical imagery features we can access images of places up to 30 years ago.&nbsp; This compilation video shows some of the more dramatic changes on earth over the past few decades:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Choose 4 time lapse videos from this compilation to examine.&nbsp; For each, watch the video a number of times and observe how the earth has changed.&nbsp; You might want to slow down the video so you can see the images more clear (click on Settings (the wheel/spoke looking thing) in the lower right side of the video and change the speed to .25).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each time lapse, write one paragraph detailing the major changes you observed, and the potential consequences of these changes.&nbsp; You should have 4 paragraphs explaining land use change.&nbsp; Each paragraph is worth 4 points.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>For your final paragraph, compare these locations.&nbsp; What location changed the most dramatically?&nbsp; Why did some places change more than others?&nbsp; What are some of the biggest implications of these changes?&nbsp; This paragraph is also worth 4 points.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,20.0,"['online_text_entry', 'online_upload']",1929556

<p>Imagine you are with your family or friends, and someone asks about why we have dramatic seasonal differences in climate in Utah, but that Pacific Islands don't change too much.&nbsp; Your task is to explain these differences based on earth-sun relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; What is the latitude of Utah (pick a city) and how does it compare to the latitude of the Pacific Islands (pick an island)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; How does the tilt of the earth on its axis impact how much energy from the sun a place receives during the year?&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; How does the tilt of the earth on its axis impact the angle of sun that a place receives?&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; How does the earth's revolution around the sun impact how much energy from the sun a place receives?&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; How does day length in Utah and the Pacific Islands compare during June and December?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure answers are complete and robust to show me that you understand the concepts!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">To calculate the angle of the sun above the horizon, you can use shadows!&nbsp; In this exercise, you will measure the length of shadows at three times during the day, and use the length of the shadow to calculate the angle of the sun above the horizon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">For this exercise you will need a camera, something to cast a shadow (a friend, child, or other large object), a ruler or tape measure, and chalk (or someway to mark where you are measuring the shadows).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">To measure shadows, follow these directions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Find a place outside away from large trees to measure the shadow. This could be an unobstructed driveway or street, parking lot, or sidewalk.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Draw one circle to mark where you will stand to take the picture, and one mark for where the person or object will stand.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Measure the height of your object, friend, or child.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">At three different times in the day (between 8-9 am, between 12-1 pm, and between 3-4 pm), go outside and measure the shadow.</span>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Have the person or object stand in their mark and measure how long their shadow is, record what direction the sun is coming from, and what direction their shadow is projected.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">After you have measured the shadow, go to your mark and take a picture.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Ask the person (or feel the object) what the sun and heat feels like.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Repeat three times during the day.</span></li>

<p>In this assignment, you will explore the soil in your yard, a park, or somewhere you can dig a small hole. &nbsp;You will first classify the soil based on texture feel, and then consult a soil map to see how your results compare.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this activity, you will need a small bottle of water, a measuring cup, a ruler or tape measure, and some paper towels to clean off your hands between samples.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Classifying soil texture </strong></p>
<p><strong>1) </strong>Collect three soil samples at different depths in your yard, a park, or somewhere you can dig a small hole.&nbsp; You will want to make sure the first soil sample is below the organic layer (the upper most part of the soil where grass roots and other plant matter decay are present).&nbsp; Collect about ½ cup of soil at each sample depth.&nbsp; Make sure to record the depth at which the sample was taken. Include images of the samples and the soil pit/hole you dug.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2) </strong>After you have collected the samples and recorded their depth, perform a texture feel analysis.&nbsp; The flow chart below (scroll all the way to the end, or find it here: &nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/nrcs142p2_050352.jpg"">https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/nrcs142p2_050352.jpg</a>) provides you step-by-step directions to analyzing your soil texture.&nbsp; Here is a good YouTube video that demonstrates various aspects of the test:&nbsp; <a class="""" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWZwbVJCNec"" data-ytt-failcnt=""1"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWZwbVJCNec</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Record your results in the table below. &nbsp;</p>

<p>First, choose 3 people that you will talk to regarding climate change.&nbsp; These people can be family members, friends, co-workers, neighbors, or anyone else!&nbsp; In your interviews, ask the people about their concern over climate change, some potential solutions, and their perceptions on how others think.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Here are some example questions</strong> (you can use these if you want):&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>How often do you read, hear about, or discuss climate change?</li>
<li>What do you think most people in the United States believe about climate change?&nbsp;</li>
<li>What are the major contributing factors in contemporary climate change?&nbsp;</li>
<li>What do you think are the most pressing issues related to climate change?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Write one paragraph for each interview that summarizes their responses.&nbsp; (3 paragraphs total).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you have interviewed and examined their responses, compare their responses to information presented in these two sites:&nbsp; <a href=""https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2018/?est=happening&amp;type=value&amp;geo=county"">Climate Change Opinion Maps</a> and <a href=""https://skepticalscience.com/argument.php"">Climate Change Myths</a>.&nbsp; For each of these sites, examine the information presented on the sites, and then answer these questions:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>How did your participants ideas about what people believe about climate change compare the climate change opinion maps project?&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Look at the Utah data.&nbsp; How did your participants answer to what the opinion map says about how people think about climate change in Utah?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The science of climate change is clear, but many myths persist amongst the general public.&nbsp; Were there any common myths about what is causing climate change that your participants discussed?&nbsp; For example, many people think that earth's natural cycles of heating and cooling are what we see now, or that there is no scientific consensus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>How do these myths compare to the scientific explanations presented on the Skeptical Science website?&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>On the <a href=""https://skepticalscience.com/argument.php"">website</a>, you will see a list of myths and then you can click on ""What the Science says"" to learn more about the evidence and data behind climate science.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How you could you use this Skeptical Science to help others understand the science behind anthropogenic climate change?&nbsp;</li>

The purpose of this paper is to see if you can take things from the past and find some application to present day.&nbsp; So let your creative mind wander.&nbsp; If you happen to pick an economist, tell a little about them and their economic philosophies and then relate their philosophies to today’s economic situation.</p>
<p>If you happen to pick a topic covered in class or another of your choosing, the same process would apply.&nbsp; Take the first part of the paper to introduce the concepts you chose, and then spend the remainder applying those principles to present day economic situations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The length of the paper should be about 5-6 pages of text and should include at least 3 references.&nbsp; The format of the paper should follow one style of writing and citing works (ie MLA, APA, Turabian).&nbsp; <strong>The paper is due July 31, 2021.&nbsp; Any papers turned in after this date will receive a 10% penalty.</strong></p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,100.0,['online_upload'],1929556

<p><strong>Information about this dataset:</strong></p>
<p>On April 15, 1912, the largest passenger liner ever made collided with an iceberg during her maiden voyage. When the Titanic sank it killed 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck resulted in such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, <a href=""http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1166/problem12.html"" target=""_blank"">some groups of people were more likely to survive than others</a>.</p>
<p>The data presented in this workbook are taken from the actual Titanic passengers manifest. It consists of one target (survived) and three features (ship status, age, and gender). There are 2201 instances in the dataset and no missing values within the instances.</p>

<p>Use the Codes of Ethics you were asked to read in this module or a Code of Ethics from a professional organization to apply a code of ethics for each professional relationship you will encounter in your career. You will need to provide one code of ethics and the name of the professional organization (such as SANS). Then you should describe an IT/IS/IM situation that reflects your relationship to that person. Do not repeat codes or situations.&nbsp; Answer the questions in the blanks below the document in the space provided below each question. Use complete sentences, correct grammar, punctuation, spelling, and writing style. Prove <strong>quality depth</strong> when answering the questions. Below is an example of a professional relationship with employers.</p>

As a faculty member, I needed to review the policies that protect students and ensure that I use proper safety procedures. Along with knowing the procedures to protect others, however, I needed to learn new ways to make my courses effective for students as classes went online. My employer provided trainings, Teams meetings, and references so I could have current knowledge. It was my responsibility to utilize the materials provided to me.</p>

<p>Conduct research to obtain information on cultural issues (specified in the template) for the country that is assigned to you. You should have at least five (5) sources, including the NRI 2022 and 2023 reports.</p>
<p>Use reliable sources. Do not use blogs, discussion boards, Wikipedia, or travel web sites as citations. Those sites may give you ideas for furthering your research, but they are not appropriate for citations in an academic paper.</p>

<p>Describe the primary<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>cultural aspects</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>that would be important to know for an organization considering opening an IT business in that country.&nbsp;In particular, you will address language, holidays observed and other events impacting work (such as weekend work, holy days, start/end times, etc.), and business etiquette/work-related behavior.

<p>The<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>education section<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>addresses two indicators (quality of education and R&amp;D by Government and Higher Education) of the Network Readiness Index, using the 2022 and 2023 reports. Include the ranking and score for each indicator. Compare the scores and rankings between the two reports to see if the quality of education and higher education rates improved, decreased, or stayed the same. In addition, describe the types and quality of higher education computing programs, such as IT.</p>
<p>Edit the main title (first-level heading) to include the name of the country you are researching and edit the running head in all capital letters to match the main heading.</p>
<p>Include a short introductory paragraph (about three sentences) after the (main) first-level heading. The<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>second-level headings</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>are included in the template for you. Provide specific evidence to substantiate your discussion. Include statistics and measurable data from reliable sources.&nbsp; Include internal citations in APA format (7th edition).</p>
<p>The content should be about&nbsp;four&nbsp;pages double-spaced.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reference Page:</strong></span></p>
<p>Sample references are included on the Reference page. Read the comments and apply the rules when entering your sources in APA format (7th edition). Use hanging indents, arrange the sources in alphabetical order by authors' last names, and double-space the sources. Delete the comments and sample sources.</p>
<p>Refer to the two videos in Canvas regarding the references. Refer to OWL for APA requirements. However, for the purposes of this paper, the formatting for web site references is slightly different. Treat the web page title as an article name, not a journal title. If an author is not available, include an editor's name. If that is not available, use the organization's name as the author when applicable.</p>
<p><span><strong>Writing Style:</strong></span></p>
<p>The writing style should be formal and objective. It should not sound like a casual conversation. Do not use first-person pronouns (I or we) or second-person pronouns (you).</p>

<p><span><strong>Sources:</strong></span></p>
<p>Conduct research to obtain information on indicators for the country assigned to you. You should have at least five (5) sources.<span> <em>National Readiness Index</em></span><em> Reports</em> PDFs count as two sources.</p>
<p>Use additional reliable sources. Do not use blogs, discussion boards, Wikipedia, or travel websites as citations. Those sites may stimulate ideas for furthering your research, but they are inappropriate for academic paper citations.</p>
<p><span><strong>Content (Information, Evidence, Citations):</strong></span></p>
<p>Using data from the National Readiness Index Reports, research these indicators:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.1.1 Individuals Using Internet</li>
<li>1.1.3 Households with Internet Access</li>
<li>2.1.3 Use of Virtual Social Networks</li>
<li>1.1.7 Internet in Schools</li>
</ul>
<p>For each indicator, include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indicator definition and scaling (see appendix ii of NRI for years reported, definitions, etc.)</li>
<li>Annual score, percentage, etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Annual ranking&nbsp;</li>
<li>Additional paragraph with related supplemental information from external sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit the main title (first-level heading) to include the name of the country you are researching, and edit the running head in all capital letters to match the main heading.</p>
<p>Include a short introductory paragraph (about 3-4 sentences) after the (main) first-level heading. The<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>second-level headings</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>are included in the template for you. Provide specific evidence to substantiate your discussion.&nbsp;Include statistics and measurable data from reliable sources.&nbsp; Include internal citations in APA format.</p>
<p>The content should be at least four full or five pages double-spaced, including the conclusions and recommendations.</p>
<p><span><strong>Conclusions and Recommendations:</strong></span></p>
<p>Draw objective conclusions for each indicator based on the evidence provided by the NRI books and external sources. Do not simply summarize the data or repeat it. Conclusions provide analytical meaning to the evidence you previously presented. When writing conclusions, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the meaning of the data?</li>
<li>What trends can be identified?</li>
<li>What is the “bottom line” of the evidence?</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the conclusions, what recommendations do you have for the government? Recommendations are action items for the reader (the government, in this case) to address. Look for ways to improve the issues addressed by the indicators.</p>
<p>The recommendations should flow naturally from the conclusions. Each conclusion must be addressed with a respective recommendation.</p>
<p><span><strong>Do&nbsp;<u>not</u>&nbsp;include statistics, quotations, references, or&nbsp;citations in the conclusions and recommendations sections. All evidence should be presented before the conclusions.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Reference Page:</strong></span></p>
<p>Sample references are included on the Reference page. Read the comments and apply the rules when entering your sources in APA format(7th edition). Use hanging indents, arrange the sources alphabetically by authors' last names, and double-space the sources. Delete the comments and sample sources.</p>
<p>Refer to OWL for APA requirements. Refer to the two videos in Canvas regarding the references. The article name of a web page is treated as an article title, not a journal-title. If an author is not available, include an editor's name. If that is unavailable, use the organization's name as the author when applicable.</p>
<p><span><strong>Writing Style:</strong></span></p>
<p>The writing style should be formal and objective. It should not sound like a casual conversation. Do not use first-<span>person pronouns (I or we) or second-person pronouns (you).</span></p>

<p><strong>Some questions to think about as part of the discussion: (Remember that you do not have to answer all of these questions, just some that interest you.)</strong><br>1. Why is software important to automobiles?</p>
<p><strong>VW article questions:</strong> Based on the article, what seems to be the competitive advantage of Tesla? Which aspect of Tesla is hard for VW and other auto incumbents to match? “Over the past 20 years the auto industry became more integrators than developers,” said one quoted manager. What light does this quote shed on the competitive disadvantage of VW? What mistakes did VW make and how is VW attempting to learn from its mistakes? In retrospect, was Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess right in trying to compete head-on with Tesla?&nbsp;The aforementioned quoted manager says: “Software is written by suppliers. This was good for a while because it drives down costs but you lose control. That’s what the auto industry has to reverse now, bring in deep technical knowledge. That’s the hard part.” Does this quote summarize the basic dilemma that VW is facing? Or would you summarize the VW dilemma differently?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Waymo questions: </strong>What is Waymo? Would you like a self-driving car? Why? Would you apply for the early rider program if offered in Utah county?&nbsp;<a class=""external"" href=""https://waymo.com/apply/"" target=""_blank"">https://waymo.com/apply/<span class=""screenreader-only"">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline"" title=""Links to an external site.""><span class=""screenreader-only"">Links to an external site.</span></span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Given Waymo's ultimate goals, what specific data would you like to capture about each test-driving experience?&nbsp;<a class=""external"" href=""https://medium.com/waymo/apply-to-be-part-of-waymos-early-rider-program-5fd996c7a86f"" target=""_blank"">https://medium.com/waymo/apply-to-be-part-of-waymos-early-rider-program-5fd996c7a86f<span class=""screenreader-only"">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline"" title=""Links to an external site.""><span class=""screenreader-only"">Links to an external site.</span></span></a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class=""external"" href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2017/04/25/waymo-launches-early-rider-program-expands-self-driving-fleet-with-fiat-chrysler/#620134d3d1af"" target=""_blank"">https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2017/04/25/waymo-launches-early-rider-program-expands-self-driving-fleet-with-fiat-chrysler/#620134d3d1af<span class=""screenreader-only"">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline"" title=""Links to an external site.""><span class=""screenreader-only"">Links to an external site.</span></span></a>&nbsp;Who are Waymo's competitors, and what are they up to? Problems with self driving cars:&nbsp;<a href=""http://discovermagazine.com/2018/nov/baby-can-you-drive-my-car"">http://discovermagazine.com/2018/nov/baby-can-you-drive-my-car&nbsp; </a>Why is Waymo testing its driverless car flett in Chandler Arizona rather than Chicago Illinois? States and federal regulators are still trying to determine how to best oversee the technology to ensure safety while also encouraging its development. What are some guidelines to achieve these conflicting goals (safety vs development). Also, how much should governments be willing to trust autonomous car manufacturers?</p>

<li>How is the national environment of India changing for Google, Facebook and Twitter? Why is it harder for them to do business there? Why are foreign Internet companies no longer as welcome in India as they once were?</li>
<li>WhatsApp seems to be of special interest to the Indian authorities. Why is that? Why is WhatsApp such a sensitive app?</li>
<li>What specifically are these Internet companies being asked to do? How reasonable are the government requests? What are the threatened sanctions for failing to abide?</li>

<p>Some questions to think about: Big Tech has grown even more this past year. Is the power of Big Tech good or bad? Should the Big Tech companies be broken apart? Will the economic and societal forces propelling Big Tech to even higher heights outlast Covid-19? Why or why not? Who are the big losers of the pandemic? Who are the big winners of the pandemic? Judging by the articles, the US economy now seems less competitive. What evidence is there of this development? What does this say about the stock market rise?</p>

<p>*Your group will invite a guest speaker to come on campus and present to the class.&nbsp; You will need to make whatever arrangements she/he needs to be to class on time.&nbsp; They have 25 minutes to present and 5 minutes for questions at the end of the presentation.</p>
<p>If we go to live streaming because of COVID during any time through out the semester:</p>
<p>COVID 19 Assignment update-----------------------</p>
<p><span>You will need to <strong>record the interview and post it to the discussion board for others</strong> to watch and comment on. The rest of the class will watch the interview and post responses in the discussion. I will create the discussion threads for each speaker.&nbsp; ---------------------------</span></p>
<p><u>Speakers must be currently working in an IS, IT, or closely related field. </u><br><br><strong>Presentation topics</strong> to&nbsp; be discussed by the speaker (<strong>make sure you let the guest speaker know</strong>): <br>A. Share current employment responsibilities, educational background, certifications, and any other job experiences. <br>B. Tell a few war stories (tough situations)<br>C. Lessons learned in career path to date<br>D. Any recommendations you would offer to the students that would help them to be successful in their careers. <br>E. Time for Questions at the end of the presentation (Difficult during COVID, but if they left some kind of contact so that they could answer questions on email would be great!)</p>
<p><strong>Group Outputs:</strong></p>
<p>1. Group Summary Paper (instructions in Group Paper Assignment)</p>
<p>2. Personal Team Evaluation (instructions in Team Evaluation Assignment)</p>
<p>3. Thank you note or email to speaker (cc me or send copy to me)</p>
<p><strong>Instructions for individual speaker responses for all students:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Open Canvas and create a posting under the Guest Speaker Discussion for that speaker</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Take notes, write down your reactions to what is being said</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Once presentation is over, feel free to ask any questions (Is your company hiring, beginning salaries, does your company facilitate job shadowing, is there part time employment at your company, what skills are required to start at the bottom in your company, etc.)</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Post your comments - at least 3 things you learned or that you will use in the future.</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; Guest speakers often come with part-time and full-time job opportunities.&nbsp; If you are interested in working for the company that the guest speaker is from, I strongly suggest that you take the time to get his/her contact information and ask at least one question.&nbsp; Guest Speakers provide many opportunities for employment now or in the future.&nbsp; Networking is very important.</p>
<p>*-----Pre-COVID Instructions: Invite, schedule, and make any other arrangements for a guest speaker to come and speak for 25 minutes and then answer questions for 5 minutes at the end. Example: Make parking arrangements, check to see what they need for their presentation, be prepared to introduce your guest speaker to the class.&nbsp; When your guest speaker comes, all group members should be present to get credit for the assignment.&nbsp; If you can not be there, I need to know why and have written documentation to support your good reason.&nbsp; Medical, death in the family, or other extenuating circumstances or examples for not being there!

<p>Before you do any of the exercises in this book, you need to install Python. In addition, you need to install the source code for this book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Part 1 (Exercise 1-1) Experiment with IDLE's interactive shell</h3>
<p>Complete the following steps using Exercise 1-1 in the textbook.</p>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Start IDLE. That should display a window for the interactive shell</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/537634/files/111332047/preview?verifier=sEW0nAsqbz8EIlqDqFjoFuwg7XCqjMCGlsERkiOU"" alt=""default Python IDLE shell window"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/537634/files/111332047"" data-api-returntype=""File"">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Enter the following functions and arithmetic expressions into the interactive console (replace FirstName and LastName with your first and last name):</li>
<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ul>
<li>print(""FirstName Lastname"")&nbsp;# Print my first and last name</li>
<li>print() # Print a blank line</li>
<li>40 + 5 # Add 40 plus 5</li>
<li>25 - 7 # Subtract 7 from 25</li>
<li>7 * 3 # Multiply 7 and 3</li>
<li>10 / 5 # Divide 10 by 5</li>
<li>2 * 10 + 5&nbsp;# Multiply 2 and 10, then add 5</li>
<li>2 * (10 + 5) # Add 10 and 5, then multiply 2</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Take a Screenshot of your IDLE screen and put it in a word document</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Save your Word document as LastnameFirstnameParticipationMO2 (replace Lastname &amp; Firstname with your name)</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<ul>
<li>Close your IDLE window and start a new IDLE shell and enter the following<br>
<ul>
<li>print(""FirstName Lastname"") # Print my first and last name (replace FirstName $ LastName with your name)</li>
<li># Create two variables</li>
<li>var1 = 25</li>
<li>var2 = 18</li>
<li>var1 + 14 # Add 14 to the first variable</li>
<li>var1 # Display value of first variable</li>
<li>var1 + var2&nbsp;# Add both variables together</li>
<li>var_2 # Display unknown variable</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that you will get an error on the last input as var_2 has not been given a value.</p>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Take a Screenshot of the IDLE shell and paste it below your last screenshot in your word document.</strong></span></li>

<h2><span id=""kl_banner_right"">MO3: Participation</span></h2>
<p>Before you do any of the exercises in this book, you need to install Python. In addition, you need to install the source code for this book.</p>
<p>In this participation, you will learn how to</p>
<ul>
<li>test and modify existing code</li>
<li>gather input from the user</li>
<li>do basic math calculations</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hint: If you have any problems with you test your changes, please refer to figure 1-9 of chapter 1, which shows how to fix syntax and runtime errors.</em></p>
<h3>Part 1 - (2-1) Modify the Miles Per Gallon Program</h3>
<p>Complete the following steps using Exercise 2-1 in the textbook.</p>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Start the IDLE shell and open the following file: <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file"" title=""mpg.py"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/537634/files/111332138?verifier=IpSzepp2xc03UjB6SWELfoxjUInAphWlFwM3nQsq&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/537634/files/111332138"" data-api-returntype=""File"">mpg.py</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Press F5 to compile and run the program. Then, enter valid values for miles driven and gallons used. This should display the miles per gallon</li>
<li>Test the program with invalid entries like spaces or letters. This should cause the program to crash and display error messages for the exceptions that occur</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use the print function to add text on the second line of code just after the shebang line that displays your first and last name along with the text MPG App. Make sure to add pseudocode to the right.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>e.g., Kodey Crandall's MPG App</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Modify this program so the result is rounded to just one decimal place, then test this change.</li>
<li>Modify this program so the argument of the round() function is the arithmetic expression, then test this change.</li>
<li>Modify this program so it retrieves the cost of a gallon of gas as an entry from the user. Then, calculate the total gas cost and the cost per mile, and display the results on the console as shown in the example below:</li>
</ul>
<pre>Enter miles driven: 150<br>Enter gallons of gas used: 15<br>Enter cost per gallon: 3<br><br>Miles Per Gallon: 10.0<br>Total Gas Cost: 45.0<br>Cost Per Mile: 0.3</pre>
<ul>
<li>Take a Screenshot of the results in the IDLE Shell and paste it into a word document named: [LastName][FirstName]ParticipationM03.docx</li>
<li>Add pseudocode for EVERY line of source code</li>
<li>Save the file with a new name [LastName]_[FirstName]_MO3P1</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe style=""border: none;"" src=""https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/618b7ded-8c91-47e3-a54e-ef00429d698f?autoplay=false&amp;showinfo=true"" width=""640"" height=""360"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<h3>Part 2 - (2-2) Modify the Test Scores Program</h3>
<p>Part 2 will have you modify the Test Scores program in figure 2-16 of the textbook. When you're finished, the program will display the three scores entered by the user in a single line.</p>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<ul>
<li>Start the IDLE shell and open this file: <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file"" title=""test_scores.py"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/537634/files/111332130?verifier=iGxjhb6yJKzT4jeBVnxJfYAUyhU0fjpFuRgfpO64&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/537634/files/111332130"" data-api-returntype=""File"">test_scores.py</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Save this file with a new name (File-&gt;Save As): [LastName]_[FIrstName]_MO3P2</li>
<li>Press F5 to compile and run the program. Then, enter valid values for the three scores. This should display the results.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 5&nbsp; &nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use the print function to add text on the second line of code that displays your first and last name along with the text Test Scores App. Make sure to add pseudocode to the right.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>e.g., Kodey Crandall's Test Scores App</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<ul>
<li>Modify this program so it saves the three scores that are entered in variables named score1, score2, and score3.</li>
<li>Add these scores to the total_score variable, instead of adding the entries to the total_score variable without ever saving them.</li>
<li>Add a print function to display all individual scores just before the total score print function.</li>
<li>Add pseudocode for EVERY line of source code.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<ul>
<li>Display the scores that have been entered before the other results, as shown below</li>
</ul>
<pre>Enter 3 test scores<br>=======================<br>Enter test score: 75<br>Enter test score: 85<br>Enter test score: 95<br>=======================<br>Your Scores: 75 85 95<br>Total Score: 255<br>Average Score: 85</pre>
<ul>
<li>Take a Screenshot of the results in the IDLE Shell and paste it into the same word document created in Part 1</li>
<li>Save the file.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe style=""border: none;"" src=""https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/2cbc1cb3-c62f-410b-ba72-7e00893e1ed5?autoplay=false&amp;showinfo=true"" width=""640"" height=""360"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<h3>Part 3 - Create a simple program</h3>
<p>Copying and modifying an existing program is often a good way to start a new program. So in this, you'll copy and modify the MPG program so it gets the length and width of a rectangle from the user, calculates the area and the perimeter of the rectangle, and displays the results in the console</p>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<ul>
<li>Start the IDLE shell and open this file: <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file"" title=""mpg_model.py"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/537634/files/111332071?verifier=9vFkZKN4ncwFPAAvt0zYyF5dJQP8T1nvo7fC89gW&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/537634/files/111332071"" data-api-returntype=""File"">mpg_model.py</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Save this file with a new name (File-&gt;Save As): [LastName]_[FIrstName]_MO3P3</li>
<li>Use the print function to add text on the second line of code that displays your first and last name along with the text Test Scores App. Make sure to add pseudocode to the right.
<ul>
<li>e.g., Kodey Crandall's Rectangle App</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modify the code for this program so it works for the new program.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>The area of a rectangle is length times width</li>
<li>Perimeter is 2 times length plus 2 times width</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add pseudocode for EVERY line of source code</li>
<li>Save the file</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The output should look something like this</em></p>
<pre>The area and perimeter program<br><br>Please enter the length: 25<br>Please enter the width: 10<br><br>Area = 250<br>Perimeter = 70<br><br>Thanks for using this program!</pre>
<ul>
<li>Take a Screenshot of the results in the IDLE Shell and paste it into the same word document created in Part 1</li>
</ul>

<li>First start by modifying the first print() by replacing the word ""The"" with your first and last name so it prints something like this: Kodey Crandall's Miles Per Gallon application""</li>
<li>We will now enhance the application by allowing the user to enter more than one entry</li>
<li>Create a variable named another_trip and assign it the value of ""y"" just before the miles_driven pseudo code</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/537634/files/111332022/preview?verifier=XJ4FnTV5tLuLW8E0lsFZ0EU1qRldtrIw6QRh9bEw"" alt=""An arrow pointing above the miles_driven variable in the Python file for this part of the participation"" width=""496"" height=""294"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/537634/files/111332022"" data-api-returntype=""File"">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Just after your new variable, create a while loop that will continue while another_trip is equal to ""y""
<ul>
<li>HINT: while another_trip == ""y"":</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tab to the right each line below the while statement except for the last line: print(""Bye"")</li>
<li>Create a cost_per_gallon variable that receives the user input for the cost per gallon with the text: Enter cost per gallon: [User Input]</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add and elif after the gallons_used and before the else with the following condition
<ul>
<li>elif cost_per_gallon &lt;= 0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add a print() that shows the text: Cost per gallon must be greater than zero. Please try again.
<ul>
<li>This will show only if the statement is true</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Calculate the total gas cost and put it in a variable named ""total_gas_cost"" (gallons of gas used * cost per gallon)
<ul>
<li>Display the total gas cost below the MPG print method.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Calculate the cost per mile and put it in a variable named ""cost_per_mile"" (total gas cost / miles driven)
<ul>
<li>Display the cost per mile under the total gas cost</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<ul>
<li>Just after the last else statement, receive the user's input using the text: Get entries for another trip (y/n)?
<ul>
<li>Store it in the another_trip variable created earlier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add a line of pseudocode for EACH line of source code</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<ul>
<li>Save the file</li>
<li>Open the IDLE shell, run, and test the application with the following inputs:</li>
</ul>
<pre>Kodey Crandall's Miles Per Gallon application<br><br>Enter miles driven: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 125<br>Enter gallons of gas used: &nbsp;14.8<br>Enter cost per gallon: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4.18<br><br>Miles Per Gallon: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8.45<br>Total Gas Cost: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 61.9<br>Cost Per Mile: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.5<br><br>Get entries for another trip (y/n)? y<br><br>Enter miles driven: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 329<br>Enter gallons of gas used: &nbsp;9.4<br>Enter cost per gallon: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.18<br><br>Miles Per Gallon: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 35.0<br>Total Gas Cost: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20.5<br>Cost Per Mile: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.1<br><br>Get entries for another trip (y/n)? n<br><br>Bye</pre>

<h3>Part 2 - Enhance the Future Value program</h3>
<p>Part 2 of this participation will enhance the Future Value program.</p>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<ul>
<li>Download this file: <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file"" title=""future_value-1.py"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/537634/files/111332156?verifier=4t62L7kPHjCQUfW47yIWJs6tQW09NlKqFsEvVWQm&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/537634/files/111332156"" data-api-returntype=""File"">future_value-1.py</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Open the IDLE shell and test the application with valid and invalid entries
<ul>
<li>Notice that this program does not have any validation, so you will get an error with invalid entries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rename the file using the File&gt;Save As... with the name [Firstname]_[Lastname]MO4ParticipationP2.py</li>
<li>First start by modifying the first print() by replacing the word ""The"" with your first and last name so it prints something like this: Welcome to Kodey Crandall's Future Value Calculator</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create a variable named is_valid just inside the while loop (before the monthly_investment statement) and set the value to False</li>
<li>Create another while loop that loops while the is_valid variable is False and put it on the next line of code (before the monthly_investment statement)</li>
<li>Tab to the right the monthly_investment = .... statement so it executes in the while loop</li>
<li>Create an if-else statement to validate the monthly_investment with the following conditions
<ul>
<li>the monthly_investment must be greater than 0</li>
<li>AND the monthly_investment must be less than OR equal to 1000</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the results are true, set is_valid = True</li>
<li>else print the following message: Entry must be greater than 0 and less than 1000. Please try again.</li>
<li>JUST OUTSIDE the while loop (Tabbed back to the left) set is_valid = False</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 9</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create another while loop just before yearly_interest_rate = ... that loops while is_valid = False</li>
<li>Tab to the right the yearly_interest_rate = ... statement</li>
<li>Create an if-else statement to validate the yearly_interest_rate with the following conditions
<ul>
<li>the yearly_interest_rate must be greater than 0</li>
<li>AND the yearly_interest_rate must be less than OR equal to 15</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the results are true, set is_valid = True</li>
<li>else print the following message: Entry must be greater than 0 and less than 15. Please try again.</li>
<li>JUST OUTSIDE the while loop (Tabbed back to the left) set is_valid = False</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 10</h4>
<ul>
<li>Repeat Step 9 but adapt it for the year = ... statement</li>
<li>The conditions for the year
<ul>
<li>Year must be greater than 0</li>
<li>AND the year must be less than or equal to 50</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 11</h4>

<p>Before you do any of the exercises in this book, you need to install Python. In addition, you need to install the source code for this book: <a title=""Python Book Files"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/537634/pages/python-book-files"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/537634/pages/python-book-files"" data-api-returntype=""Page"">Python Book Files</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Part 1 (Exercise 4-1)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Complete the following steps using Exercise 4-1 in the textbook. This exercise will enhance the Future Value program in figure 3-17 of the textbook. It will validate the three user entries with messages if the user's input is incorrect.</p>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Start the IDLE shell and open the following file:<span> <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file"" title=""future_value-2.py"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/537634/files/111332122?verifier=iNOLUaNdOjX3wUBBJBo5aHl4xnqmNRlG1Ek1rFJj&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/537634/files/111332122"" data-api-returntype=""File"">future_value-2.py</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=""instructure_file_holder link_holder""><span class=""screenreader-only"">do</span></span></li>
<li>Press F5 to compile, run, and test the program. <em>Notice that it does not do any validation.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<ul>
<li>To help you prepare the validation for this application, you will need to create a hierarchy chart or outline that includes a get_float() and a get_int(). The get_float() will test the user's input to see if the input is a value is a float and is between two values. The get_int() will check if the user's input is an integer and is between two values.</li>
<li>To create the hierarchy chart, open Word and create shapes using the insert shapes option:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/537634/files/111332129/preview?verifier=Idri85EJo6Sy9gcho7MHNgRYsscGfY4S1VVR2IRW"" alt=""Word with the shapes option selected
"" width=""604"" height=""439"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/537634/files/111332129"" data-api-returntype=""File"">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>First, create a ""Main"" square at the top. The main method is the parent to the get_float() and get_int() methods.
<ul>
<li>Remember the guidelines for creating hierarchy charts •
<ul>
<li>The names in a chart should start with a verb and give a good indication of what the function does. Then, the names can easily be converted to Python function names.</li>
<li>Each function should do everything that is related to the function name and nothing more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create two squares under the ""Main"" square that are side-by-side. One with the text ""Get Float"" and the other ""Get Integer""</li>
<li>Connect the ""Main"" to the squares below with a line</li>
<li>Create two more squares, one under the ""Get Float"" and one under the ""Get Integer""</li>
<li>For the square under the ""Get Float"" add the text ""Display Valid Float""&nbsp;</li>
<li>For the square under the ""Get Integer"" add the text ""Display Valid Integer""</li>
<li>Connect the squares with a line</li>
<li>Save the Word document with the name [FirstName][LastName]MO5ParticipationP1</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe style=""border: none;"" src=""https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/9676d836-2d7d-4e85-b0e9-b55701a781cb?autoplay=false&amp;showinfo=true"" width=""640"" height=""360"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Open your favorite text editor (notepad++, Visual Studio Code, etc.)</li>
<li>Create a new Python file with the name validate.py</li>
<li><strong>On the first line, add a line of pseudocode: # [FirstName] [LastName] validation file for the Future Value App</strong></li>
<li>Save it in the same directory as your <span>future_value-2.py file</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Step 4</span></h4>
<ul>
<li><span>Define a new method named get_float with three parameters: prompt, low, high</span>
<ul>
<li><span>HINT: def get_float(prompt, low, high):</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Create an infinite while loop that continues while true</span>
<ul>
<li><span>HINT: while True:</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Create a variable with the name ""number"" and assign it the value of a float from the user's input</span>
<ul>
<li><span>HINT: number = float(input(prompt))</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Check to see if the number is between the low and high values. If it is return the number, if not print an invalid entry message</span>
<ul>
<li><span>HINT:</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><span>        if number &gt; low and number &lt;= high:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return number<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; else:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print(""Entry must be greater than"", low,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ""and less than or equal to"", high)</span></pre>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<ul>
<li>Repeat step 4 but for the get_int()</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<ul>
<li>Next, define a main method</li>
<li>Create a variable named ""choice"" and assign it a value of ""y""</li>
<li>Create a while loop that goes until choice.lower() == ""y""
<ul>
<li>HINT: &nbsp; &nbsp; while choice.lower() == ""y"":</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a variable named valid_number and assign it the value of the get_float()
<ul>
<li>HINT: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; valid_number = get_float(""Enter number: "", 0, 1000)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Print the valid number
<ul>
<li>HINT: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print(""Valid number = "", valid_number)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use the Print() to add space</li>
<li>Create a variable named valid_integer and assign it the value of the get_int()
<ul>
<li>HINT: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; valid_integer = get_int(""Enter integer: "", 0, 50) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Print the valid integer
<ul>
<li>HINT: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print(""Valid integer = "", valid_integer)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use the Print() to add space</li>
<li>Set choice equal to the user's input
<ul>
<li>HINT: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; choice = input(""Repeat? (y/n): "")</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the user doesn't type a ""y"" or ""Y"", print the text ""Bye!""</li>
<li>at the bottom of the file add the code&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<pre>if __name__ == ""__main__"":<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; main()</pre>
<ul>
<li>Save the file and close it</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lastly, we need to import the validation file in the <span>future_value-2.py</span></li>
<li><span>To do this, open the future_value-2.py in your favorite text editor</span></li>
<li><span>Import the validation by adding the following code on the first line of code</span></li>
</ul>
<pre><span>import validation as v<br></span></pre>
<ul>
<li><span>Print this text on the next line under the import code</span>
<ul>
<li><span>[LastName]'s Validated Future Value App</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Now, replace the float and int function calls with the get_float() and get_int() functions from the imported module</span></li>
</ul>
<pre><span>monthly_investment = v.get_float(""Enter monthly investment:\t"",1,1000)</span></pre>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to provide the proper arguments for the low and high parameters (monthly investment should be between 0 and 1000. The yearly interest needs to be between 0 and 15. Lastly, the years must be between 0 and 50).</li>
</ul>

<p>Before you put a program into production, it is essential that thorough testing and debugging is conducted. While it is true that virtually every application created has ""bugs"" but the better you become and identifying issues and fixing them before they get into the hands of the user, the better the experience the user will have. This participation will have you put your knowledge into action by testing and debugging existing applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Part 1 (Exercise 5-1)&nbsp; Test and debug a Test Scores program</h3>

<h3>Part 2 - (Exercise 5-3) Step through a Future Value program</h3>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<ul>
<li>In the Word document created from step one, add a heading text at the bottom of the last page with the following text: Part 2 - MO7</li>
<li>Start a new IDLE shell and open the following file: <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file"" title=""future_value-3.py"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/537634/files/111332161?verifier=SdhLxLLlXxMQMOpPX9sca6OXWmNbhYgbY6ywfU7I&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/537634/files/111332161"" data-api-returntype=""File"">future_value-3.py</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Review the code thoroughly but do not correct the errors if you see any.</li>
<li>Set a breakpoint on the first executable statement (monthly_interest_rate = yearly_interest / 12) by right-clicking on the statement and selecting ""Set Breakpoint"".</li>
<li>Take a screenshot of the breakpoint set and paste it under the Part 2 - MO7 heading.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<ul>
<li>In the calculate_future_value() function, set a breakpoint on the first executable statement.</li>
<li>Go to the IDLE shell and start the debugger and check the ""Source"" checkbox.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<ul>
<li>Go to the editor with the code and run the application.</li>
<li>In the Debug window, click ""Go""</li>
<li>Enter the following values:&nbsp;
<p>Enter monthly investment: &nbsp; &nbsp;50<br>Enter yearly interest rate: &nbsp; &nbsp;5<br>Enter number of years: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15</p>
</li>
<li>You'll notice that the debugger window is now active and waiting for you to take the next steps in the debug process.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the window you should see the locals area that displays the user's input values.</li>
<li>Click ""Over"" in the debug window and then take a screenshot of the debug window and the editor with the code.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>HINT: The monthly interest rate must be showing in the locals area of the debugger and your code should have ""months = years * 12"" highlighted.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Paste the screenshot in your Word document at the bottom.</li>
<li>Step through the rest of the code by pressing ""Over"" until you see the future value show up in the IDLE shell.</li>
<li>Your future value should be about 2.029377334510302e+29</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<ul>
<li>Now that you notice the calculation is incorrect, you'll need to find the errors and fix them.</li>
<li>Find the logic errors in the code by stepping through your code line by line.</li>
<li>Once you fix the errors, you should have 13420.13 as your future value with the same input values.</li>
<li>Take one last screenshot of the IDLE window with the correct future value showing and paste it in the Word document at the bottom.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create a new class called FutureValueFrames and have ttk.Frame as a parameter and add this class just above the FutureValueFrame class.
<ul>
<li>Add two columns and an exit button</li>
<li>Add two FutureValueFrame calls to display it twice side-by-side in the grid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre>class FutureValueFrames(ttk.Frame):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; def __init__(self, parent):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ttk.Frame.__init__(self, parent)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # Add the FutureValueFrames<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FutureValueFrame(parent).grid(row=0, column=0)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FutureValueFrame(parent).grid(row=0, column=1)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # Add the Exit button &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ttk.Button(parent, text=""Exit"", command=parent.destroy).grid(<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; row=1, column=1, sticky=tk.E, padx=15, pady=10)</pre>

<p>In Chapter 6, you learned about lists and tuples and how those data structures are used to support a collection of data. For this participation assignment, you'll be expected to complete a hands-on training from the textbook that will help you understand lists and tuples even better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Part 1 (Exercise 6-1)&nbsp; Use a list for the Test Scores program</h3>
<p>Complete the following steps using Exercise 6-1 in the textbook.</p>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Download this file: <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""test_scores-3.py"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/537634/files/111332157?verifier=LftXLcOXjf5eStNaTiTKlKzEu8QfceFWsESIlQwc&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/537634/files/111332157"" data-api-returntype=""File"">test_scores-3.py</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Start the IDLE shell, open the test_scores-3.py file you just downloaded.</li>
<li>Rename the file: [Lastname][Firstname]_test_scores-3.py</li>
<li>Review the code thoroughly and run the application.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Modify the get_scores() function so the test scores are stored in a list named scores. This list should be returned by the function when all scores have been entered. The function should still make sure that the entries are valid, but the score_total and count variables aren't needed and should be updated.</li>
<li>Modify the process_scores() function so the scores list is its only argument. Then this function should use a for statement to total the scores in the list. It should use the len() function to get the number of scores in the list. And it should get the average by dividing the total scores by the length.</li>
<li>Next, create new variables for the low and high scores and use the min() and max() respectively to store the values.</li>
<li>Calculate the median by first creating a median index variable to find the middle index number</li>
</ul>
<pre>median_index = len(scores) // 2</pre>
<ul>
<li>If you have an odd number of scores stored, display the average of the two middle numbers, else display the middle number.</li>
<li>Print
<ul>
<li>total</li>
<li>number of scores</li>
<li>average</li>
<li>low</li>
<li>high</li>
<li>median</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Modify the main() function so the list that's returned by the get_scores() function is stored in a variable. Then, modify the call to the process_scores() function so it passes just the scores list to it.</li>
<li>Test this program to make sure everything is working right.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add a line of pseudo-code for each line of source code</li>
<li>Save the file</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 5 Optional Extra Credit</h4>
<ul>
<li>Now that you have tested the application and everything is running correctly, you have an opportunity for extra credit.
<ul>
<li>Create a backup of your file.&nbsp;</li>
<li>For an additional 5 points towards your overall participation score, create a graphical user interface for the user's input.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test the application one more time to make sure all is working and functioning correctly.</li>
<li>Save the file with a new name : [Lastname][Firstname]_test_scores-3EXTRA.py</li>
</ul>

<p>In Chapter 7, you learned how to store data in plain text, CSV, and binary files. While these are the three types discussed in the textbook, you should also be aware that other data types like JSON and XML are also supported.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you'll modify two Python files by using the file I/O processes you learned in the chapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Part 1 (Exercise 7-1)&nbsp; Create a CSV file for trip data</h3>
<p>Complete the following steps using Exercise 7-1 in the textbook.</p>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Download this file: <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""mpg_write.py"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/537634/files/111332163?verifier=GfucoYnIG86CDlwt4DFf3V2Cwt4QzCTKAi7g1kA0&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/537634/files/111332163"" data-api-returntype=""File"">mpg_write.py</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Start the IDLE shell, open the Python file you just downloaded.</li>
<li>Rename the file: [Lastname][Firstname]_mpg_write.py</li>
<li>Review the code thoroughly and run the application.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Enhance the program so it stores the data for each calculation, or trip, in a two-dimensional list. For each calculation, these values should be put in the list: miles driven, gallons of gas used, and the calculated MPG value.</li>
<li>Enhance the program so it saves the data in the list to a file named trips.csv when the user wants to exit from the program.</li>
<li>Test the program to make sure it works. To do that, you can open the CSV file with a spreadsheet program like Excel.</li>
<li>Put a line of pseudo-code for EACH line of source code.</li>
<li>Save the file and close it.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe style=""border: none;"" src=""https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/2caadc6e-6a64-4125-b5ac-16daf964b27b?autoplay=false&amp;showinfo=true"" width=""640"" height=""360"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Part 2 (Exercise 7-2)&nbsp; Keep trip data in a CSV file</h3>
<p>In this part of the participation, you'll modify the Miles Per Gallon program so it adds to the data in the file that you create in part 1. This program should display the data for each trip that's entered in a CSV file.</p>
<p>Example of the completed solution:</p>
<p><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/537634/files/111332121/preview?verifier=vgx6xMUyeijaurfnWdtldWNYS5EI44rShfsoePHe"" alt=""Participation 7 solution file.

<li>Start the IDLE shell, open the Python file you just downloaded.</li>
<li>Rename the file: [Lastname][Firstname]_mpg.py</li>
<li>Review the code thoroughly and run the application.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add a write_trips() function that writes the data from a two-dimensional list named trips that's passed to it as an argument. This list contains the data for each trip that's entered, and it should be written to a CSV file named trips.csv. As the console above shows, the data for each trip consists of miles driven, gallons of gas used, and the calculated MPG value.</li>
<li>Add a read_trips() function that reads the data from the trips.csv file and returns the data for the trips in a two-dimensional list named trips.</li>
<li>Add a list_trips() function that reads the data from the trips.csv file and returns the data in the trips list on the console as shown above.</li>
<li>Enhance the main() function so it starts by getting the data from the CSV file and listing it as shown above.</li>
<li>Enhance the main() function so it adds the last trip that's entered to the trips list after it calculates the MPG. Then, display the data for the updated trips list.</li>
<li>Test all aspects of the program until you're sure that it works correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add a line of pseudo-code for each line of source code.</li>
<li>Save the file.</li>

<p>In Chapter 8, you learned some of the best practices for handling exceptions in Python. As a result, you should now be able to write programs that handle exceptions so your programs don't crash. And that's what you need to do in a professional program.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you'll modify two Python files and practice handling exceptions.</p>

<h3>Part 1 (Exercise 8-1)&nbsp; Add exception handling to the Future Value program</h3>
<p>Complete the following steps using Exercise 8-1 in the textbook.</p>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Download this file: <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""future_value-4.py"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/537634/files/111332070?verifier=cEzEKnhpiy0l9tuJBqyxz7X95wrZhmaj79SOVAUb&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/537634/files/111332070"" data-api-returntype=""File"">future_value-4.py</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Open the IDLE shell and rename the file: <strong>[Firstname][Lastname]_FutureValue.py</strong></li>
<li>Review the code and study the get_number() and get integer() functions.
<ul>
<li>Note that they receive three arguments: the prompt for a user entry, the low value that the entry must be greater than, and the high value that the entry must be less than or equal to. Then, review the calling statements in the main() function and note how these functions are used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test the program.
<ul>
<li>Note that you can cause the program to crash by entering values that can't be converted to float and int values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add exception handling to the get_number() and get_integer() functions so the user has to enter valid float and int values.</li>
<li>test these changes to make sure the exception handling and the data validation work correctly.</li>
<li><strong>Add a line of pseudo-code for EACH line of source code in the program</strong></li>
<li>Save the file</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Part 2 (Exercise 8-2)&nbsp; Enhance the Movie List 2.0 program</h3>
<p>In this part of the participation, you'll modify the Movie List 2.0 program so it does more exception handling. You'll also use a raise statement to test for exceptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Download this file: <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""movies2.py"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/537634/files/111332144?verifier=CCFufJD8F8Ke430G5xbqKNd9QwHSMRNWjD5HTo7c&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/537634/files/111332144"" data-api-returntype=""File"">movies2.py</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Start the IDLE shell, open the Python file you just downloaded.</li>
<li>Rename the file: [Lastname][Firstname]_movies2.py</li>
<li>Review the code thoroughly.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add data validation to the add_movie() function so the year entry is a valid integer that's greater than zero.</li>
<li>Test this change</li>
<li>Modify the write_movies() function so it also handles any OSError exceptions by displaying the class name and error message of the exception object and exiting the program.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<ul>
<li>Test the write_movie() function by using a raise statement in the try block that raises a BlockingIOError. This is one of the child classes of the OSError.
<ul>
<li>Next, comment out the raise statement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the read_movies() function, comment out the two statements in the except clause for the FileNotFound Error. Instead, use this except clause to return the empty movies list that's initialized in the try block. This should cause the program to continue if the file can't be found by allowing the program to create a new file for the movies that the user adds.</li>
<li>Test this by first running the program with the movies.csv file. That should work as before Then change the filename in the global constant to moview_test.csv, run the program again, and add a movie. That should create a new file. If that works, run the program again to check whether it works with the new file.</li>
<li><strong>Add a line of pseudo-code for EACH line of source code in the program</strong></li>
<li>Save the file.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span id=""kl_banner_right"">MO1: Project</span></h2>
<h3><strong><span>Assignment Overview:</span></strong></h3>
<p><strong>GitHub Desktop</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>is another tool that can help a team to share a repository of code or other documents (in our case, Python files).&nbsp; Before making any changes to your programs, you will need to pull the latest version of the project from the shared repository to your local machine. You can then use your own local copy of the code to make changes, compile, and test it.&nbsp; Then you can commit these changes first to the local Master. This will allow sharing online repositories by pushing the changes to others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GitHub Desktop provides a GUI version of this popular tool. The GitHub Desktop application will allow you to view your own local repositories.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Instructions:</strong></span></h3>
<p><span><strong>Step 1. Register for GitHub.</strong></span></p>
<p>Go to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>www.github.com</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and register for an account.&nbsp; If you already have an account, you may use it for this assignment.</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2. The instructor adds you to the class repository.</strong></span></p>
<p>Complete the <a title=""GitHub Username"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/537634/quizzes/1547861"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/537634/quizzes/1547861"" data-api-returntype=""Quiz"">GitHub Username</a> survey so you can be added as a team<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>member with access to the GitHub INFO1200Python/Fall2021 online repository.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait...<br>Your instructor will now add you to the course repository. You will be sent an<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>email invitation</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>you need to respond to.&nbsp; The email will be the email you used to register with GitHub.</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 3. View INFO1200Python/Summer2022 repository</strong></span></p>
<p>After accepting the email invitation you will be able to access the INFO1200Python/Summer2022 with write and read rights in the online github.com.</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 4.&nbsp; Download GitHub Desktop and Install</strong></span></p>
<p>Download<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>GitHub Desktop</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and install it on your local computer or VM.<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong><a class=""external"" href=""https://desktop.github.com/"" target=""_blank"">https://desktop.github.com/<span class=""screenreader-only"">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 5. Open GitHub Desktop and SignIn.</strong></span></p>
<p>Once you have installed the application, open GitHub Desktop on your local machine (I like to add the application to my taskbar). The<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>first time</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>you open GitHub Desktop, you will be prompted to<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>sign in</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>with your GitHub email and password. Then you will be asked to complete the Configure step by clicking<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Continue</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and then finally click the<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Finish</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>button.</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 6. Clone the Summer2022 repository</strong></span></p>
<p>The GitHub Desktop opens with a screen that, in the middle, shows three options: Create a new repository, Add to an existing repository, or Clone a repository.&nbsp; Choose to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Clone a Repository.</strong>&nbsp; Choose the INFO1200Python/Summer2022 repository and click the Clone button.&nbsp; By default, the repository will be copied to your local machine, usually in<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>C:\Users\Documents\GitHub\<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>folder.</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 7. View Summer2022 repository in Explorer<br></strong></span>In GitHub Desktop, you should now be able to view the Summer2022 repository in Explorer, or you can actually browse to your<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>C:\Users\Documents\GitHub\&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>Find your local<span> <strong>Summer2022</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span>repository folder.&nbsp; Open the folder.&nbsp; Notice there may be two Github files added to your folder:&nbsp; a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>.githubattributes</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>.gitignore</strong>.&nbsp; These are the files that link this local folder to the online Github repository.&nbsp; Do not change or delete these files because this is how GitHub tracks changes in your project.</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 8.&nbsp; Create a new file in the repository.<br></strong></span>Open the start.py file in your local repository by opening it in Notepad (or similar text editor. My favorite is VS Code) and do a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>SaveAs</strong>.&nbsp; Save this file as<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>FirstNameLastName.py</strong>.&nbsp; (select All Files or will be a .txt file)&nbsp; Modify the Python <span>&nbsp;</span><strong>name</strong><span> variable </span>in your new file to include<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>your full name (Replace Kodey Crandall with your name)</strong><br>Save the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>FirstNameLastName.py</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>file and close it.</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 9.&nbsp; Commit to Master (Save changes locally)</strong></span><br>Go back to the GitHub Desktop local panel, and you will see you now have<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>1 changed file</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to your local version. In the bottom left, you will see Created FirstnameLastName.py<strong>&nbsp;and a Description</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>for your changed file<strong>.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>You can add a description saying you created this copy of the start file.&nbsp; Then you need to click the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Commit to Master</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>button.&nbsp; This will only save this change to your local repo.&nbsp; You should now see<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>0 changed files</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>in your GitHub Desktop panel.&nbsp; This only commits these changes to your local repository.</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 10.&nbsp; Push Origin, Push changes to GitHub.com repository</strong></span></p>
<p>To get your changes up to the class Github Fall2021 repository, you will need to click the <strong>Push origin<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>link. You may be asked to first<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>pull origin</strong>&nbsp;or<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>fetch origin</strong>.&nbsp; (Note: you may need to use the Repository menu-&gt;Pull before it lets you do a Push) After completing the push origin, this will push these local commits you made to your master to the online GitHub.com version of the Summer2022 repository.</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 11.&nbsp; Verify Changes in GitHub.com repository</strong></span><br>Go back to the online repository in github.com.&nbsp; Go to the INFO1200Python/Summer2022 project. In the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Commits,</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>you should be able to view your commit with the changes you made. Your instructor will check the list of commits to find your commit to the class repository when grading this assignment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span><strong>Summary:</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>I hope this tool helps you manage your source control for your project along with any other documents that need maintaining, sharing, and editing.</span><br><br><span>You are more than welcome to create your own repository in GitHub for your projects and assignments throughout the semester using this source control. This is also a great way to backup your work. As a student, you should be able to have a private repository from GitHub that you can use for your assignments if you wish.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is not enough space on our class repository to hold your projects. If you decide not to use GitHub, you should choose another method/tool to manage/backup your code.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span><strong>Submission:</strong></span></h3>
<p>Submit the text ""I have completed the MO1: Project GitHub assignment.""<br>Your instructor will then check in the class GitHub<span> <strong>Summer2022</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span>repository to view the commit you have made with your name and date.&nbsp; Make sure to use your complete name in the edited file so your instructor can give you credit for your work.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<ul>
<li>Display the results of the tip amount with the text: Tip amount: [Calculated Tip]</li>
<li>Display the Total meal cost with the text: Total amount: [total meal cost]</li>
<li>Add a space using the print()</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 9</h4>
<ul>
<li>Save the file</li>
<li>Open the IDLE shell and test your application. The output should look something like this with the meal cost of $500:</li>
</ul>
<pre>Kodey Crandall's Tip Calculator<br><br>Cost of meal: 500<br><br>15%<br>Tip amount: &nbsp; 75.0<br>Total amount: 575.0<br><br>20%<br>Tip amount: &nbsp; 100.0<br>Total amount: 600.0<br><br>25%<br>Tip amount: &nbsp; 125.0<br>Total amount: 625.0</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Part 3 - Change Calculator</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">Create a program that calculates the coins needed to make change for the specified number of cents.</p>
<p class=""p1"">For Part 3, you will show your understanding of modulo and integer divide operators.</p>
<h4>Step 10</h4>
<ul>
<li>Open your favorite text editor (I like Visual Studio Code)</li>
<li>Create a new .py file and save it with the name [FirstName][LastName]_MO4P3.py</li>
<li>Add the following pseudocode agreement on the first line</li>
</ul>
<pre><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#Name: (First Name Last Name)</span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#Class: (INFO 1200)</span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#Section: (X01)</span><br><span><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#</span><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">Professor: (Crandall)</span></span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#Date:<br>#Project #: MO4_P3</span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#I declare that the source code contained in this assignment was written solely by me.</span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#I understand that copying any source code, in whole or in part, </span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#constitutes cheating, and that I will receive a zero on this project</span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#if I am found in violation of this policy.</span></pre>
<ul>
<li>Use the print() to show the text: [FirstName] [LastName]'s Change App</li>
<li>Replace the placeholders with your own first and last name</li>
<li>Add a space using the print()</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 11</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create a variable named choice and give it a value of ""y""</li>
<li>Create an infinite while loop that remains in memory while choice is == ""y""
<ul>
<li>HINT: while choice.lower() == ""y""</li>
<li>FYI: the .lower() will make the user input lower case so if they type in a ""Y"" it will still be counted as a ""Yes""</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a variable named cents and make it equal to the users input with the following text: Enter number of cents (0-99): [User Input]</li>
<li>Add a space using the print()</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 12</h4>
<ul>
<li>Calculate the maximum number of quarters. Create a variable named quarters and use the integer divide operator (//) to determine the number of quarters.
<ul>
<li>HINT: cents // 25</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assign cents to the new value of cents using the modulo operator (%)
<ul>
<li>HINT: cents = cents % 25</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 13</h4>
<ul>
<li>Repeat step 12 for calculating the dimes, nickels, and pennies</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 14</h4>
<ul>
<li>Print the number of quarters using the text: Quarters: [# of calculated quarters]</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 15</h4>
<ul>
<li>Repeat step 14 for printing dimes, nickels, and pennies</li>
<li>Add a space using the print()</li>
<li>Ask the user to continue using the text: Continue? (y/n) and put the response in the choice variable</li>
<li>Add a space using the print()</li>
<li>If the user types ""n"" or ""N"" (or really anything but a ""y"" or ""Y"") print the text: Bye!</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 16</h4>
<ul>
<li>Save the file</li>
<li>Open the IDLE shell and test your application with the following tests cases:</li>
</ul>
<pre>Kodey Crandall's Change App<br><br>Enter number of cents (0-99): 49<br><br>Quarters: 1<br>Dimes: &nbsp; &nbsp;2<br>Nickels: &nbsp;0<br>Pennies: &nbsp;4<br><br>Continue?

<h3><strong>Part 1 - Even or Odd Checker</strong><strong></strong></h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Open your favorite text editor (I like Visual Studio Code)</li>
<li>Create a new .py file and save it with the name [FirstName][LastName]_MO5P1.py</li>
<li>Add the following pseudocode agreement on the first line</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Use the print() to show the text: [FirstName] [LastName]'s Even or Odd Checker
<ul>
<li>Replace the placeholders with your own first and last name</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add a space using the print()</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Define a new function with the name is_even that takes in one parameter named num
<ul>
<li>HINT: def is_even(num):</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inside the function create an if else statement
<ul>
<li>If the num variable passed in does not have a remainder when divided by two (Use the Modulo operator) then return true. Else return false</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Define a new function named main with no parameters
<ul>
<li>HINT: def main():</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inside the main function, print the text: [FirstName]'s even or odd checker</li>
<li>Add a space using the print()</li>
<li>Create a new variable named my_num and assign it a value from the user's input with the text: Enter an integer:&nbsp;</li>
<li>Create an if else statement that uses your new is_even function that passes in the my_num variable as a parameter
<ul>
<li>HINT: if is_even(my_num):</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the value returns true, print the text: This is an even number.</li>
<li>Else, print the text: This is an odd number</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<ul>
<li>Next, add the following code at the bottom of the file</li>
</ul>
<pre>if __name__ == ""__main__"": main()</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<ul>
<li>Open the IDLE Shell, open the file, run and test the application using the following entries
<ul>
<li>10</li>
<li>9</li>
<li>119</li>
<li>262</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Part 2 - Feet and Meters Converter</h3>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<ul>
<li>Open your favorite text editor (I like Visual Studio Code)</li>
<li>Create a new .py file and save it with the name [FirstName][LastName]_MO5P2.py</li>
<li>Add the following pseudocode agreement on the first line</li>
</ul>
<pre><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#Name: (First Name Last Name)</span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#Class: (INFO 1200)</span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#Section: (X01)</span><br><span><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#</span><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">Professor: (Crandall)</span></span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#Date:<br>#Project #: MO5_P2</span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#I declare that the source code contained in this assignment was written solely by me.</span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#I understand that copying any source code, in whole or in part, </span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#constitutes cheating, and that I will receive a zero on this project</span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#if I am found in violation of this policy.</span></pre>
<ul>
<li>Use the print() to show the text: [FirstName] [LastName]'s Feet / Meters Converter
<ul>
<li>Replace the placeholders with your own first and last name</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add a space using the print()</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create another new .py file and save it with the name [your_initials]converter.py&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Replace [your_initials] with the first and last initials of your name (e.g., kcconverter.py).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Save it in the same directory as the file created in step 6.</li>
<li>Add the following pseudocode agreement on the first line</li>
</ul>
<pre><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#Name: (First Name Last Name)</span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#Class: (INFO 1200)</span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#Section: (X01)</span><br><span><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#</span><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">Professor: (Crandall)</span></span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#Date:<br>#Project #: MO5_P2_converter</span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#I declare that the source code contained in this assignment was written solely by me.</span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#I understand that copying any source code, in whole or in part, </span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#constitutes cheating, and that I will receive a zero on this project</span><br><span class=""textLayer--absolute"">#if I am found in violation of this policy.</span></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<ul>
<li>Define a new function with the name <em>to_meters</em> and have it receive one parameter with the name <em>feet</em></li>
<li>Inside this method, create a new variable named meters and assign it a value of the feet variable multiplied by 0.3048
<ul>
<li>HINT: meters = feet * 0.3048</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Return the converted meters</li>
<li>Create another function in this file named <em>to_feet</em> that receives one parameter with the name <em>meters</em></li>
<li>Inside this method, create a new variable named <em>feet</em> and assign it the value of <em>meters</em> divided by 0.3048
<ul>
<li>HINT: feet = meters / 0.3048</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>return the converted feet</li>
<li>Save and close the file</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 9</h4>
<ul>
<li>Open the file created in step 6 using your favorite text editor</li>
<li>After your pseudocode, import the file created in step 7 and set it with the name ""c""
<ul>
<li>HINT: import kcconverter as c</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Define three new function: fm_welcome (no parameters), fm_menu (no parameters), and main (no parameters)</li>
<li>In the welcome function print the text: ""[FirstName]'s Feet and Meters Converter""&nbsp;</li>
<li>Add a space using the print()</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 10</h4>
<ul>
<li>In the fm_menu function, print three lines of text
<ul>
<li>Conversions Menu:</li>
<li>a. Feet to Meters</li>
<li>b. Meters to Feet</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 11</h4>
<ul>
<li>In the main function, call the fm_welcome function</li>
<li>Create a while loop that executes while True</li>
<li>Inside the while loop, call the fm_menu function</li>
<li>Next, create a new variable named choice and assign it a value from the user with the text: Select a conversion (a/b):&nbsp;</li>
<li>Add a space using the print()</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 12</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add an if, elif, else statement</li>
<li>In the if, check to see if choice is set to ""a""</li>
<li>In the elif, check to see if choice is set to ""b""</li>
<li>In the else, print the text: You did not enter a valid selection</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 13</h4>
<ul>
<li>Inside the first ""if"" statement, create a feet variable with the assigned value of the user's input with the text: Enter feet:&nbsp;</li>
<li>Still inside the if statement, create another variable named meters and assign it the value c.to_meters(feet)
<ul>
<li>HINT: c refers to the imported file from step 9</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Print the meters rounded to two decimal places with the text ""meters"" at the end
<ul>
<li>HINT: print(round(meters, 2), ""meters"")</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 14</h4>
<ul>
<li>Repeat step 13 but with converting meters to feet instead</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 15</h4>
<ul>
<li>Outside the if, elif, else statements, create a new variable named more and assign it the user's input with the text: Would you like to perform another conversion? (y/n):&nbsp;</li>
<li>Add a space using the print()</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 16</h4>
<ul>
<li>Next, create an if statement that checks if ""more"" is NOT set to ""y""</li>
<li>If the if statement is true, then print the text: Thanks, bye!&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Inside the if after the print ""Thanks, bye!"" text, do a break statement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the very end of your file, add this code</li>
</ul>
<pre>if __name__ == ""__main__"": main()</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 17</h4>
<ul>
<li>Test your application with the following inputs</li>
</ul>
<pre class=""p1"">Conversions Menu:<br><br>a. Feet to Meters<br>b. Meters to Feet<br>Select a conversion (a/b): a<br><br>Enter feet: 100<br>30.48 meters<br><br>Would you like to perform another conversion? (y/n): y<br><br>Conversions Menu:<br><br>a.

<h2>MO8 - Right Triangle and Custom App&nbsp;</h2>
<h3><span id=""background"">Overview</span></h3>
<p class=""p1"">Now that you have some experience creating Python applications with a GUI, it is now time to build one on your own. For this project, you will create two Python applications from scratch that have a GUI.</p>
<p class=""p1"">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span id=""background"">Part 1: Right Triangle Calculator</span></h3>
<p class=""p1"">Create a GUI program that calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle after the user enters the lengths of the two short sides and clicks the Calculate button.</p>
<h4>Step 1<strong></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class=""p1"">Use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the length of the third side. The Pythagorean Theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse of a right-triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the opposite sides:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class=""p1"">c<span class=""s1"">2 </span>= a<span class=""s1"">2 </span>+ b<span class=""s1"">2</span></p>
</li>
<li><span class=""s1""><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/537634/files/111332143/preview?verifier=wE9w0Yqhi8nOsB4dUjM1ukETtzjfujU1lUiufgYO"" alt=""A right triangle with a, b, and c as the side identifiers."" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/537634/files/111332143"" data-api-returntype=""File""></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""p1"">As a result, you can calculate side C like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class=""p1"">&nbsp;c = square_root(a<span class=""s1"">2 </span>+ b<span class=""s1"">2</span>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class=""p1"">Side C should be rounded to a maximum of 3 decimal places</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""p1"">Make sure the user enters valid int values, and display any data validation messages in a message box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""p1"">Test this program and to find and fix all of the syntax, runtime, and logic errors that it contains.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add a line of pseudo-code for each line of source code</li>
<li>Save the file(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span id=""background"">Part 2: Custom GUI Application</span></h3>
<h4>Step 4<strong></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Using the knowledge you learned from the chapter, create a simple GUI application of your choosing.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Your program should have at least SEVEN controls (e.g., button, label, text entry, etc.)&nbsp;</li>

<h2>MO9 - The Wizard's Inventory&nbsp;</h2>
<h3><span id=""background"">Overview</span></h3>
<p class=""p1"">For this application, you will need to create a Python application that allows a wizard to carry a magic item that is stored in a list. To help the user Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) the list items, you'll need to create a command menu (Step 1).</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Assignment Specifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class=""p1"">Use a list to store the items. Provide three starting items.</li>
<li class=""p1"">The wizard can only carry four items at a time.</li>
<li class=""p1"">For the edit and drop commands, display an error message if the user enters an invalid number for the item.</li>
<li class=""p1"">When you exit the program, all changes that you made to the inventory are lost.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1"">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span id=""background"">Create the Command Menu</span></h3>
<h4>Step 1<strong></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Open your favorite text editor (I like Visual Studio Code)
<ul>
<li>Create a new .py file and save it with the name [FirstName][LastName]_MO9.py</li>
<li>Add the following pseudocode agreement on the first line</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Define a display_title() function and have it
<ul>
<li>use the print() to show the text: [FirstName] [LastName]'s Wizard Inventory Game
<ul>
<li>Replace the placeholders with your own first and last name</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>add a space using the print()</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Define a display_menu() function and have it
<ul>
<li>Use the print() function several times to show the following text <strong>with a space after</strong>:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre class=""p1"">COMMAND MENU<br><br>show - Show all items<br>grab - Grab an item<br>edit - Edit an item<br>drop - Drop an item<br>exit - Exit program<br><br></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class=""p1"">Define a main() function</p>
</li>
<li>Call the display_title() function and the display_menu() function created in step 1.
<ul>
<li>Test the program to see if the functions work as expected. You should see the title and the command menu</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create an inventory list variable that has three items by default every time the user runs the application
<ul>
<li>be creative and come up with your own items for the user.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre>inventory = [""staff"", ""item2"", ""item3""]</pre>
<ul>
<li>Create a while loop that executes until the user types exit.
<ul>
<li>Inside the loop, store the user's input in a variable called ""command""</li>
<li>Next, create an if, elif, elif,... for each of the command menu items</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre>while True: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; command = input(""Command: "") &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if command == ""show"":<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>show(inventory)</em><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; elif command == ""grab"":<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>grab_item(inventory)</em><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; elif command == ""edit"":<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>edit_item(inventory)</em><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; elif command == ""drop"":<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>drop_item(inventory)</em><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; elif command == ""exit"":<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; break<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; else:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print(""Not a valid command.

<ul>
<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ul>
<li>HINT: Notice the show, grab_item, edit_item, and drop_item methods are not yet created. We will do this in the next few steps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add the following at the bottom of your code:</li>
</ul>
<pre>if __name__ == ""__main__"": &nbsp;main()</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 3<strong></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Create a show() function that receives the inventory as a parameter</li>
<li>In the show function, create a for loop that loops through all items that are held by the wizard</li>
</ul>
<pre>for number, item in enumerate(inventory, start=1):<br>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print(f""{number}. {item}"")</pre>
<ul>
<li>Add a space after using the print() function</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create a grab_item() function that receives the inventory as a parameter</li>
<li>If the number of items is more than or equal to 4, display the text ""You can't carry any more items. Drop something first""</li>
<li>else, have the user type in the item name and store it in a variable named item
<ul>
<li>add the item to the inventory list</li>
<li>then, show the text {item} was added</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre>if len(inventory) &gt;= 4:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print(""You can't carry any more items.

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create an edit_item() function that receives the inventory as a parameter</li>
<li>Have the user enter in the item number he/she would like to edit and store it in a variable named ""number""</li>
<li>Make sure the user types in a number that is 1 or more and less than the number of items in the inventory</li>
<li>If the number entered is invalid, show the text ""Invalid item number""</li>
<li>else, have the user type in the new name for the item and show the text ""Item {number} was updated""</li>
</ul>
<pre>number = int(input(""Number: ""))<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; if number &lt; 1 or number &gt; len(inventory):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print(""Invalid item number.\n"")<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; else:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; item = input(""Updated name: "")<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inventory[number-1] = item<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print(f""Item number {number} was updated.\n"")</pre>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create the last function: drop_item() and pass in the inventory as a parameter</li>
<li>have the user enter the item number he/she would like to drop</li>
<li>if the number is a valid number, have that item be removed from the list.</li>
<li>if it is invalid, show the text ""Invalid item number""</li>
</ul>
<pre>number = int(input(""Number: ""))<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; if number &lt; 1 or number &gt; len(inventory):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print(""Invalid item number.\n"")<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; else:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; item = inventory.pop(number-1)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print(f""{item} was dropped.\n"")</pre>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add a line of pseudo-code for EACH line of source code you created.</li>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create an add(contacts) function that receives the contacts as a parameter.</li>
<li>Get the user's input for the name, email, and phone in that order and store the values in new variables named: name, email, and phone respectively.</li>
</ul>
<pre>name = input(""Name: "")<br>email = input(""Email: "")<br>phone = input(""Phone: "")</pre>

<ul>
<li>Once complete, show the text ""{contact[0]} was added.""</li>
<li>Add an empty space after.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 9</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create the write_contacts(contacts) function and have contacts as a parameter.</li>
<li>Similar to the read() function, we will need to open, write, and close the file</li>
</ul>
<pre>with open(FILENAME, ""w"", newline="""") as file:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; writer = csv.writer(file)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; writer.writerows(contacts)&nbsp;</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 10</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create a delete(contacts) function that receives the contacts as a parameter.</li>
<li>Create an instance of the number variable and assign it the value of get_contact_number(contacts).</li>
<li>If the number returned is greater than 0, remove it from the list using the .pop() function call,</li>
<li>Next, show the text ""{contact[0]} was deleted, and then write the changes to the file.</li>
</ul>
<pre>number = get_contact_number(contacts)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; if number &gt; 0:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; contact = contacts.pop(number-1)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print(f""{contact[0]} was deleted.\n"")<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; write_contacts(contacts)</pre>
<h4>Step 11</h4>
<ul>
<li>Test the application thoroughly to ensure there are no syntax or logical errors.</li>
<li>Add a line of pseudo-code for EACH line of source code you created.</li>
<li>Save the file.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 12 Optional Extra Credit (up to 5 points)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create a Graphical User Interface with buttons for each of the command items.</li>
<li>Test the application to ensure everything works as expected with each of the buttons</li>

<h2><span id=""kl_banner_right"">M01: Assignment 1 - The College Search Form and Console App</span></h2>
<p>As people are considering going to college, they may ask themselves where the school is located. For this application, you will create both a Python application and C# console application to search the city of a given college. You may notice that I do not give you step-by-step instructions for most projects. You are to take your knowledge from the participation and apply what you have learned.</p>
<h3>Overview Video</h3>
<p><iframe style=""border: none;"" src=""https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/89e91667-896a-4871-9ff0-8d940c2822f6?autoplay=false&amp;showinfo=true"" width=""640"" height=""360"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Part 1: Python</h3>
<p>Using participation 1, create a python file that prompts a user to type in a college name. If the college is found in the database (.txt file) have the program respond with both the city and the college name. If it is not found, display an error message that states the college is not found in the database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Part 2: C#</h3>
<p>Create the same application as Part 1, but now use C#.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The output should look something like this:</p>
<p><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/547764/files/112187266/download?verifier=A2KemrmgvAsDORCBzQthztTpzeK84Hes3tEHgfwf"" alt=""Console Example-1.jpg"" width=""902"" height=""481"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/547764/files/112187266"" data-api-returntype=""File""></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>&nbsp;Finding a Random College</h3>
<p>This feature will most likely take a significant amount of time. You'll need to research and find a solution for this additional feature:</p>
<p>If the user types ""random"", the system will select a random college and display the college name and city. The response from your program should use the Random class to select a random number between 0 and the size of the dictionary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THIS FUNCTIONALITY WILL BE REQUIRED FOR BOTH THE C# AND PYTHON PROGRAMS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you find yourself struggling for more than 1 hour, please signup for a time to meet with me during my posted office hours so I can give you some pointers. These projects are meant to stretch you but are not meant to be impossible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id=""kl_banner"">Steps to complete the random college and city using C#:</h4>

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After showing the college information, the program loop should continue prompting the user to ask for a college until the user types x to exit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example Colleges:</p>
<pre>Utah Valley University,Orem<br>Brigham Young University,Provo<br>The University of Utah,Salt Lake City<br>...</pre>
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<p>First, you will need to read in a .txt file that has the colleges stored (you'll need to create this manually).</p>
<p>Each college will need to be stored in a dictionary.</p>
<p>The user's input will be the ""key"" to the dictionary, and the value pair will be returned if it is found.</p>
<p>For EACH line of source code, you will need to put a line of pseudo-code.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;Assignment 2 - Multiform XAML Nutrition Tracking Application</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Calorie counting applications are a dime a dozen, but what about a nutrition tracking application? You decide not to limit yourself and set out to develop a prototype of an application that reads in foods with a total of <strong>28 </strong>(that’s right) nutrition-related attributes. Attributes vary from food name and serving size, to protein grams and Vitamin B6 and C. In the first version of your application (this assignment), you will read the foods into a ComboBox.&nbsp; When you select an item from the ComboBox, a second form will appear with all the nutrition details of that particular food item.&nbsp; Figure 1 and Figure 2 show screenshots of the application in action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>PURPOSE</h3>
<p>This assignment tests your ability to create and use multiple forms as well as collection classes (<em>ArrayList</em> and <em>Dictionary</em>).&nbsp; The food items will be read from a text file into the <em>ArrayList</em> within the <em>ComboBox</em> as well as a <em>Dictionary</em>. The <em>Dictionary</em> will be used to ""lookup"" the food item when the user selects it from the GUI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>
<p>Your assignment will be made up of three classes: <em>MainWindow</em>, <em>DetailWindow</em>, and the <em>Food</em> class. You can ignore the App class. The classes are shown in the UML class diagram found in Figure 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key Points to Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>MainWindow</em> will open, use, and close the data&nbsp;file (<a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file"" title=""nutrition.txt"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/547764/files/112187206/download?verifier=ywkmN6OClxUPYQwIaEdwk0HwMCvNxdEnhdRe0nDM&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/547764/files/112187206"" data-api-returntype=""File"">nutrition.txt</a>). <br>
<ul>
<li>Download the <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file"" title=""nutrition.txt"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/547764/files/112187206/download?verifier=ywkmN6OClxUPYQwIaEdwk0HwMCvNxdEnhdRe0nDM&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/547764/files/112187206"" data-api-returntype=""File"">nutrition.txt </a>&nbsp;before you begin.</li>
<li>The file consists of all the food nutrition data for this program.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the <em>MainWindow</em> constructor method, you should call a new method named <em>OpenText. </em>
<ul>
<li>The <em>OpenText</em> method will need to read the file and store its contents in a dictionary that can be used later to display the details of a selected food item.</li>
<li>As you read the file, add each food name to the dropdown list (Figure 1)</li>
<li>Also, on each iteration (line read from file), you should create an instance of the <em>Food</em> class and add it to the <em>Dictionary</em>, using the food name as the key in the dictionary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When an item is selected on the <em>MainWindow</em>, the corresponding food object should be retrieved from the <em>Dictionary</em>, and that food object should be passed to the <em>DetailWindow</em> via a method called <em>SetNutritionalValues</em>(Food food) so it can be displayed.
<ul>
<li>Similar to the participation assignment for this module</li>
<li>The <em>DetailWindow</em> should be launched in a modal fashion, using the method <em>ShowDialog</em>().</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The method <em>SetNutritionalValues</em>(<em>Food food</em>) in <em>DetailWindow</em> will be quite long as there are many details for each food item. This method receives a Food object and must assign all the property values from the <em>Food</em> object to</p>
<p><img role=""presentation"" src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/547764/files/112187230/download?verifier=rj3UzwdnCsXnfuneFt6WjGURhQe2VVxwHWumjjFB&amp;wrap=1"" alt="""" width=""389"" height=""221"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/547764/files/112187230"" data-api-returntype=""File""></p>
<p>Figure 1 - The Window with the Combo Box</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Food details page is quite extensive. Therefore, I would like to provide you with the GUI so you can spend most of your time on this project understanding the logic and programming concepts: <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""NutritionDetailsWindow.txt"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/547764/files/112187221?verifier=LjovBym7SvKxQPdvCramVSL2zZBnQ4MaGUdVRXUf&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/547764/files/112187221"" data-api-returntype=""File"">Details GUI</a></p>

<p>Figure 3 - Class Diagram for Nutrition Tracker, Assignment 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ""Content"" property of each label from the DetailWindow is designated to display values from the dictionary values. There will be 28 different assignments to get all the properties from Food, assigned to the Labels on DetailWindow. The assignment statements will vary depending on whether the Food property is a string or a double. The Content property of a Label can only display a string so if the property is a double, you must call the ToString() method on the property.</p>
<p>Figure 4 illustrates a couple of assignment statements to pull data from the properties in Food and assign the values to the Content property of the Label from DetailWindow.</p>
<table width=""624"">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width=""624"">
<p>lbFoodName.Content = food.FoodName;</p>
<p>lbFoodType.Content = food.FoodType;</p>

<p>Now, we will focus on writing the XAML that produces the Windows in our application. Figure 5 shows a mockup for the Main Window. The window by default has a Grid ""object element"". The GroupBox ""object element"" can be created by dragging the icon from the toolbox and dropping it on the Grid or by typing in the XAML. Make sure the GroupBox tag is not self-closing so that you can add the ComboBox ""object element"" inside of the GroupBox. You can set the sizes of the controls based on the sizes shown in Figure 5.</p>

<h2><span id=""kl_banner_right""><span>Assignment 3 - Object-Oriented XAML Application</span></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Create a windows presentation foundation (WPF) application, shown in Figure 1. You can choose any three types of animals, real or mythical.</span></li>
<li><span>Create an abstract Animal class with string properties for </span><span>SkinType</span><span>, </span><span>FoodType, </span><span>and methods called </span><span>Eat()</span><span>, </span><span>Move()</span><span>, and </span><span>Reproduce()</span><span> that all return strings. Make three virtual methods: </span><span>Eat()</span><span> and </span><span>Reproduce()</span><span>&nbsp;and make</span><span> Move()</span><span>. Add an abstract method called </span><span>Unique()</span><span> that returns a </span><span>string</span><span>. The </span><span>Animal</span><span> class should have a constructor with two arguments whose values are assigned </span><span>SkinType </span><span>and </span><span>FoodType</span><span>. The </span><span>Eat()</span><span>, </span><span>Move()</span><span>, and </span><span>Reproduce()</span><span> methods should just return a string of your choosing, for example:</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre><span>public virtual string Eat()</span><br><span>{</span><br><span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return ""chomp chomp"";</span><br><span>}</span><br><br><span>public virtual string Move()<br></span><span>{</span><br><span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return ""hippity hop"";</span><br><span>}</span><br><br><span>public virtual string Reproduce()</span><br><span>{</span><br><span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return ""create offspring"";</span><br><span>}<br><br>public abstract string Unique();</span></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li><span>Extend the </span><span>Animal</span><span> class and create 3 derived classes for any three animals. Derived classes should have a method called </span><span>Unique</span><span> that overrides the abstract </span><span>Unique</span><span> method declared in the base class. The derived classes should also override the virtual </span><span>Move()</span><span> method from the base class. The method called </span><span>Unique</span><span> should do something uniquely specific to the animal being created. For example, if you choose a dog, a </span><span>Dog</span><span> class might have a </span><span>Unique</span><span> method that returns ""WagsTail"" or ""CatchesFrisbee"".</span></li>
<li><span>Add window controls to select any of the 3 animals</span></li>
<li><span>Pictures of the animals should change when their radio button is selected.</span></li>
<li><span>Add six buttons, two are for the properties </span><span>SkinType</span><span> and </span><span>FoodType</span><span>, three are for the methods and </span><span>Eat</span><span>, </span><span>Move</span><span>, and </span><span>Reproduce</span><span>, and one is for the </span><span>Unique</span><span> method as shown in Figure 1.</span></li>
<li><span>When each button is clicked, display text (returned from the methods) in a label showing that the animal can access its inherited properties and methods. When the unique attribute button is clicked, populate the label showing your animal can perform its unique method as shown at the bottom of Figure 1.</span></li>
<li><span>Create a SINGLE Animal object in the class and give it the type once the radio button is selected.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<pre><strong>Animal animal;</strong></pre>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9. Then, assign the correct derived type animal once the radio button is selected. For example (Remember to pass in the correct parameters):</span></p>
<pre><strong>animal = new Dog("""",""""); // if dog radio button is selected</strong></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now that the derived classes are encapsulated by the base class, the unique method will access the string from the correct derived class method (polymorphism). At compile time, the object is of data type </span><span>Animal</span><span> and the </span><span>Unique</span><span> method is abstract. At runtime, a </span><span>Dog</span><span> object, a </span><span>Cat</span><span> object, and a </span><span>Chicken</span><span> object are instantiated and assigned to the </span><span>Animal</span><span> object once the radio button is selected. C# is compiled-time typed, except in the case of polymorphism where the runtime calls the correct version of </span><span>Unique</span><span> depending on the type of object that is assigned to the animal variables at runtime.</span></p>

<h2><span id=""kl_banner_right"">Working with Databases</span></h2>
<p><span>For Assignment 4, you are to create an application to connect a Windows Form application to a SQL database. The table contains recommended movies from different sources and it is up to you to create a search by title and find the first 20 movies in the database. The name of the database is INFO2200_Crandall and the name of the table is MovieTable. Below are the credentials for accessing the online database.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>URL: bigdata1.ad.uvu.edu</span><br><span>Connect using SQL Server Authentication</span><br><span>Username: jbmuser</span><br><span>Password: jellybellymovie</span><br><span>Database: <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>INFO2200Crandall</strong></span></span><br><span>Table: Movie</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Figure 1 is the landing page for the application you will create. You will need to first create a connection to the online database (if you are off-campus, you will need to VPN into the campus network). Next, you will use the data sources window to add the table adapter and then create the search functionality, and sorting (A-Z, Z-A, and First 20 by ID).</span></p>
<p><span>Please read the requirements below to help you receive full points.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/547764/files/112187116/preview?verifier=iN7IyIMw5ASFK51sTIh1tyIwVQIPThBThibiFWNY"" alt=""MovieFig1.png"" width=""414"" height=""362"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/547764/files/112187116"" data-api-returntype=""File""></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, you will need to create one more form that displays the category counts for each of the individual categories. You will use a stored procedure that is already stored in the database to complete this action.</p>
<h4>Steps:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new connection to the database</li>
<li>Don't add a table, but add the stored procedure</li>
<li>Drag the data table on the new form just like you did with the other data sets</li>
</ol>

<h2><span>Assignment 5 - Entity Framework and LINQ</span></h2>
<p><span>For Assignment 5, you are to create an application much like Assignment 4. The main difference between assignment 5, however, is that you are not allowed to use datasets. The JellyBelly table contains JellyBelly flavors from different categories. You will use Entity Framework to build your local database and use the text file below to insert the JellyBellies in your table. (We will not be using BigData1 for this assignment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a new WindowsForm application using the .NETFramework and add a class that looks like this (be careful when copying this into the class page—you should NOT have a class within a class). You'll also need to add some assembly references to get rid of the errors—just hover over the errors to figure out what to add:</p>
<pre class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">[Table(</span>""JellyBellyTable""<span class=""s1"">)]</span><br><span class=""s1""><span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp; </span></span>public class <span class=""s2"">JellyBelly</span><br><span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp; </span>{<br><span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>[Key]<br><span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class=""s3"">public</span> <span class=""s3"">int</span> JellyBellyId { <span class=""s3"">get</span>; <span class=""s3"">set</span>; }<br><br><span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>[StringLength(30)]<br><span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class=""s3"">public</span> <span class=""s3"">string</span> jellyBellyFlavor { <span class=""s3"">get</span>; <span class=""s3"">set</span>; }<br><br><span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>[StringLength(30)]<br><span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class=""s3"">public</span> <span class=""s3"">string</span> category { <span class=""s3"">get</span>; <span class=""s3"">set</span>; }<br><span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp; </span>}</pre>
<p>Once the database is created,</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Package Manager Console
<ul>
<li>Type: enable-migrations
<ul>
<li>Didn't work? Try typing this and then run ""enable-migrations"" again: Install-Package EntityFramework -IncludePrerelease</li>
<li>Did the project fail to build? Just comment out all the sections that have errors (red squigglies) and run the enable-migrations command again.</li>
<li>Getting a context type error? Right-click your project, add a new item, select data, select the ADO.NET Entity Data Model, select the ""empty code first model"", rename it to JBModel or something relevant<br>
<ul>
<li>In the created cs page, uncomment this line of code: public virtual DbSet&lt;entity&gt;... and so on</li>
<li>Replace the uncommented line of code with this: public virtual DbSet&lt;whateverYourJellyBellyClassIsCalled&gt; JellyBellies {get; set;}</li>
<li>Run the enable-migrations command again</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The enable-migrations command creates the migrations folder. You should now have two jellybelly related pages: the jellybelly class that has the provided code snippet up top and the JBModel entity data model page with the autogenerated code. You should also have a migrations folder in your solution explorer!</li>
<li>In the Configuration.cs file that was created, change the value of AutomaticMigrationsEnabled to <strong>true</strong></li>
<li>Back in the Package Manager Console type: update-database -Verbose</li>
<li>Your database should be created, and a table called JellyBellyTable should also be in the database</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run a query using the following file: <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""JellyBellyData.txt"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/547764/files/112187237?verifier=KYfgeLOOueir4A0tEzMBnDtdWM96KNWOOPZjM7R4&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/547764/files/112187237"" data-api-returntype=""File"">JellyBellyData.txt</a>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>To do this, open the SQL Server Object Explorer</li>
<li>Right-click on the new database</li>
<li>Select new Query</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Complete the project using the following screenshots and steps.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In order to create the results displayed in Figure 5, you will need to run a ""GROUP BY"" query that totals the number of jelly belly flavors per category. You have two options when it comes to LINQ syntax: QUERY syntax and METHOD syntax. </span></p>
<p><span>In Figure 6, you have query syntax and in Figure 7 you have method syntax. All queries are ultimately converted to method syntax, but you are allowed to write the query using query syntax if so desired. Note that we have assumed in the code examples in Figures 6 and 7 that your ListView was titled lvCategory. Again, you are free to use the code from either figure to complete your </span><strong>GROUP BY</strong><span> LINQ query.</span></p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>For assignment 6, you are to create a new client-server application. You will need to create 2 projects within 1 solution. For example, you could name your solution Assignment6CS and then name your client project ClientApplicationForm and your server project ServerApplication.</p>
<p>You will need to start the server application from the command line, while the client application can be started within Visual Studio. Figure 1 shows the GUI for the client application. The only new addition is the icon used on the form (upper left-hand corner). The icon is set using the Icon property of the form. You can create your own icon or use the one uploaded with the assignment.</p>
<p>The <em>ReadOnly</em> property on the textbox on the GUI should be set to true.&nbsp; The textbox is grayed out because it is <em>ReadOnly</em>.&nbsp; Also, the <em>WordWrap</em> and <em>Multiline</em> properties of the textbox should be set to true.&nbsp; The scrollbar appears due to the <em>Multiline</em> property being set to true.</p>
<p>The GUI is separated into 2 sections by Group boxes.&nbsp; There is a group box for the REQUEST information and a group box that displays the RESPONSE from the server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Figure 1 – The client GUI</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The server should be able to respond with a UVU fact, a UVU major, or simply echo back the text that was sent.&nbsp; To get a fact back send the server the text ‘UVUFact’. To get a major, send the server the text ‘UVUMajor’.&nbsp; If neither joke nor conspiracy is sent to the server, the server will just echo back what it was sent. Figure 2 shows an example of the server response when the text ‘UVUFact’ is sent to it.&nbsp; Figure 3 shows an example of the server response when the text ‘UVUMajor’ is sent to it.</p>

<p>The client is pretty simple.&nbsp; Most of the client code involves setting up the GUI and then managing the connection to the server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The server code has more responsibility.</p>
<ul>
<li>The server must listen on port 11000 for a client request.</li>
<li>The server is a console application.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The server after receiving a UVUFact request is shown in Figure 4.</p>

<p>Figure 4 – The UVUFact/UVUMajor server listening on port 11000</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The server must listen on port 11000 for a synchronous client connection.&nbsp; When the connection is established, the server must read the request text from the network stream.&nbsp; If the text sent equals ‘UVUFact’, then the server must return a random fact.&nbsp; If the text equals ‘UVUMajor’ then the server must return a random major. If the client did not send the text ‘UVUFact’ OR ‘UVUMajor’, then the server should just write back what text the client did send over.</p>
<p>The UVUFacts and the UVUMajors work the same way as Assignment 1.&nbsp; A text file of UVU facts (<a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file"" title=""UVUFacts.txt"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/547764/files/112187090/download?verifier=0s330lpKOYdWO16hFQWGbe9HOcDERQSyzMM5l963&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/547764/files/112187090"" data-api-returntype=""File"">UVUFacts.txt</a>) and a text file of UVU majors (<a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file"" title=""UVUCourseDescriptions.txt"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/547764/files/112187249/download?verifier=rzJwL0j79MQNZzoKuE660LXiNDtPI4A3LmyXmIVi&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-canvas-previewable=""false"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/547764/files/112187249"" data-api-returntype=""File"">UVUCourseDescriptions.txt</a>) have been uploaded to Canvas.&nbsp; Save these files to the bin/Debug directory of the server project.&nbsp; Create a class (let’s call it UVUResponse) that reads in the files when the class object is instantiated.&nbsp; Each fact/major should be read into a separate List&lt;string&gt; data structure.&nbsp; The UVUResponse class should have a method that returns a random fact and a method that returns a random major.</p>
<p>When the ServerApplication receives a response from the client, it should read the text from the NetworkStream.&nbsp; If the text is equal to ‘UVUMajors’, then it should call the GetUVUMajor method of the UVUResponse class. If the text read is equal to ‘UVUFacts’, then it should call the GetUVUFact method of the UVUResponse class. If the client does not request a UVUFacts or UVUMajors, then return the text that was passed to the server. Once the server acquires its appropriate response text, then it should WriteLine the response back to the client and the client should display the response in the <strong><em>Multiline</em> Textbox.</strong></p>

<h2>Earthquake API Assignment 7</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this assignment is to help you as a student learn how to build a mobile application that interacts with an Application Program Interface (API). An API is a set of routines, protocols, and tools to help build application software that interacts with a given set of logical rules build by other developers. Most API requires an API key to interact with it so requests are tracked (mainly for security reasons). For example, Phillips Hue smart lights use an API (paired with a key) to send a request to change the color, brightness, and state (on/off) of the lights. This is accomplished by sending a request over a network and having the API do something with that request. The <strong>USGS Earthquake Catalog</strong> is another API that can be used to get earthquake details of a given location, earthquake size, date, and much more.</p>
<p>This project will have you use the Earthquake API (<a href=""https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/#callback"">https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/#callback</a>) to get the current earthquake data based on the user input of a date range and magnitude of earthquakes. After the user provides the data, the API request will then return the most recent earthquake for the input provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Task</h3>
<ol>
<li>Build a cross-platform application using Xamarin to interact with an API</li>
<li>Use the <a href=""https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/#callback"">https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/#callback</a> documentation to build an application that communicates with the API</li>
<li>Requests will be sent to the Web API</li>
<li>Responses from the API will be received</li>
<li>The most recent earthquake will be displayed to the user</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Criteria</h3>
<p><em>Deliverables: </em>A mobile application that interacts with the Earthquake API.</p>
<p><em>Grading:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Data received from the API is correctly displayed</li>
<li>One RANDOM earthquake is correctly formatted and displays the location and size.</li>
<li>All C# code is free from syntax errors</li>
<li>All C# code is free from logical errors</li>
<li>All C# code is commented (A line of pseudo-code above each line of source code and a block of pseudo-code above each method)</li>
<li>The project is turned in on time.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 1: &nbsp;Create a <strong>single-page</strong>&nbsp;application that receives a date range and earthquake magnitude from the user to produce information for the results.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Read the API documentation (<a href=""https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/#callback"">https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/#callback</a><u></u></li>

<h3>Step 2: Connect to the API using C#</h3>
<ul>
<li>In C#, you will need to use WebClient. This class can be accessed using the&nbsp;using&nbsp;System.Net;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Example Code:</em></p>
<pre>using (WebClient wc = new WebClient())<br>{<br>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wc.Headers[HttpRequestHeader.ContentType] =&nbsp;""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"";<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;string json = wc.DownloadString($""<a href=""https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=xml&amp;starttime=2014-01-01&amp;endtime=2014-01-02&amp;minmagnitude=5"">https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&amp;starttime={StartDate}&amp;endtime={EndDate}&amp;minmagnitude={EarthquakeSize}</a>"");<br>}&nbsp; &nbsp;</pre>
<ul>
<li>Create a try-catch block to get each value out of the JSON received.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>To process the JSON, you will need to store the values in JSON Objects. In C# this can be done using the JObject class (using&nbsp;Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;)</em></p>
<p><em>Example Code:</em></p>
<pre>JObject jo = JObject.Parse(json);<br><br>JObject main = JObject.Parse(jo[""metadata""].ToString());</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 3: Create a class (does NOT have to be static) to store the values from the API</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a new class called Earthquake.cs</li>
<li>Create public variables
<ul>
<li>public string EQLocation { get; set; }</li>
<li>public string EQSize { get; set; }</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Store the values in the new class variables</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Review the JSON code below and see the code sample on how to process the data. Notice how the first nodes are ""type"", ""metadata"", and ""features"".</p>
<p>To get the total number of earthquakes from the given input, you will need to process the first node of ""metadata"".</p>
<p>To get the features from each of the earthquakes, we will need to create an array of JSON objects (JArray). The reason we know this is the [ ] brackets immediately following the features node.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/547764/files/112187207/preview?verifier=KmLE1Qdz5gOhwTwfTGonu4sqABI8JcSUcinkRE6B"" alt=""JSON code:

<p>Figure 2: JSON code<em></em></p>
<p><em>Example Code to process the JSON:</em></p>
<pre>// Get the number of earthquakes<br>int count = 0;<br>int.TryParse(EQmetadata[""count""].ToString(), out count);<br><br>// Creates a list of earthquakes and gets values from the API<br>List&lt;Earthquake&gt; eqList = new List&lt;Earthquake&gt;();<br>int idx = 1;<br>foreach (var eq in eQjArray)<br>{<br>  JObject eqJObj = JObject.Parse(eq[""properties""].ToString());<br>  Earthquake earthquake = new Earthquake<br>  {<br>    EarthquakeId = idx,<br>  &nbsp; Magnitude = double.Parse(eqJObj[""mag""].ToString()),<br>  &nbsp; Place = eqJObj[""place""].ToString()<br>  };<br>  eqList.Add(earthquake);<br>}</pre>
<h3>Step 4: Display the results of ONE random earthquake from the list received</h3>
<pre>Random random = new Random();<br>int randeq = random.Next(1, eqList.Count + 1);<br>Earthquake displayEQ = eqList[randeq - 1];<br>lblResults.Text = $""There were {count} earthquakes during this time.\n\n"" +<br>  &nbsp;$""Details of one of them:\nPlace: {displayEQ.Place}, \nMagnitude: {displayEQ.Magnitude}."";</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hint: The API may return a 400 error if there are too many earthquakes returned. You may want to try to put in the input below to see if you get the same number of earthquakes.</p>

That being said, students may notice INFO 1200 now uses Python as the primary language, AND this course mainly focuses on C#. This may sound troubling and some may wonder why it is if the languages are different. Well, if taught correctly, students should now have a base understanding of basic programming principles that can be integrated and applied to other similar programming languages. Wow... that's a lot of justification and explanation for why we are starting with an assignment like this.</p>
<p>For this participation, students will program in BOTH Python and C# to help familiarize themselves with both languages to see the similarities and differences and to be able to transition to C# (which is the primary language we will be working with this semester).</p>
<p>Students will begin by first creating a Python application (Part 1) to create a simple lookup game using the U.S. States and Capitals. In the console, the user will first enter a state, and the program will return one of two things: 1) the corresponding capital based on the State entered, or 2) a message that displays ""The state {userinput} is not in the database"".</p>
<p>Complete the following steps to create a Python program that accomplishes the previously mentioned details.</p>

<p>Step 0: Create a new project that uses the C# WPF Application (.Net Framework) template</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: Design the GUI</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The MainWindow.xaml on line 1 will have a Window tag. Inside that tag, you will need to add/modify the following:
<ul>
<li>Title=""FirstNameLastName Phones"" (replace with your name)</li>
<li>Height=""250"" (Should be there already. Just change the number if necessary)</li>
<li>Width=""800"" (Should be there already. Just change the number if necessary)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add a Grid inside the window tag that has one column and two rows.
<ul>
<li>The row MUST have equal heights (use the asterisk * for the heights)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the first row, add a ComboBox with the following attributes:</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<pre class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">x</span>:<span class=""s1"">Name</span>=""CbPhones""<br><span class=""s1"">Grid.Row</span><span class=""s2"">=""0""</span> <br><span class=""s1"">Margin</span><span class=""s2"">=""30""</span><br>VerticalContentAlignment<span class=""s2"">=""Center""</span><br><span class=""s1"">FontSize</span><span class=""s2"">=""30""</span></pre>
<ul>
<li>In the second row, add a button with the following attributes:</li>
</ul>
<pre class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">x</span>:<span class=""s1"">Name</span>=""BtnDetails""<br><span class=""s1"">Content</span><span class=""s2"">=""View Details""</span><br><span class=""s1"">Grid.Row</span><span class=""s2"">=""1""</span><br><span class=""s1"">Margin</span><span class=""s2"">=""30""<br><span class=""s1"">FontSize</span>=""30""</span><br><span class=""s1"">Click</span>=""BtnDetails_Click""</pre>

<p>Step 2: Create a second window</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a new window by right-clicking the project name &gt; Add Window &gt; Window (WPF)</li>
<li>Name the new window PhoneDetailsWindow
<ul>
<li>Add/modify the attributes at the end of the window tag</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Title</span>=""FirstName LastName Phone Details"" (replace with your name)<br><span class=""s1"">Height</span>=""450""<br><span class=""s1"">Width</span>=""800""</pre>
<p>Step 3: Design the GUI of the Phone Details Window</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a grid with <strong>no</strong> columns and <strong>no</strong> rows</li>
<li>Inside the grid tag, add a GroupBox with one attribute
<ul>
<li>Margin=""30,30,30,100""</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inside the GroupBox tag, add a grid with 5 rows and 2 columns (each with equal heights and widths)
<ul>
<li>Add a label in EACH cell in the grid as shown in the screenshot below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>HINT: Remember to give x:Name attributes to all the labels on the right side.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Add a button outside the GroupBox but inside the outer grid. The button will have the following attributes:</li>
</ul>
<pre class=""p1"">x<span class=""s1"">:</span>Name<span class=""s1"">=""BtnClose""</span> <br>HorizontalAlignment<span class=""s1"">=""Center""</span> <br>VerticalAlignment<span class=""s1"">=""Bottom""</span> <br>Content<span class=""s1"">=""Close""</span> <br>Margin<span class=""s1"">=""0,0,0,20""</span> <br>Height<span class=""s1"">=""50""</span> <br>Width<span class=""s1"">=""500""</span> <br>FontSize<span class=""s1"">=""20""</span> <br>Click<span class=""s1"">=""BtnClose_Click""</span></pre>

<p>Step 4: Create a C# Phone Class</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Phone class with the following public readable (get) and writable (set) properties: Make (string), Model (string), Display (string), Storage (string), Price (decimal).</li>
<li>Create a constructor method that receives a string array called phone.</li>
<li>Set all the properties in the constructor method to each string[] value passed in
<ul>
<li>For example: Make = phone[0];</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 5: Modify the MainWindow.xaml.cs</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a class scope dictionary that stores a key-value pair of string, Phone</li>
</ul>
<pre class=""p1"">Dictionary&lt;<span class=""s1"">string</span>, Phone&gt; phoneDict = <span class=""s1"">new</span> Dictionary&lt;<span class=""s1"">string</span>, Phone&gt;();</pre>

<p>Getting a program to work is good, but making your code more efficient and having it function correctly is what we strive for in program development. One of the most common mistakes programmers make is developing code that is inefficient by having a lot of duplicated code. For this participation assignment, you will create an application that manages the details of stored plants. The objectives of this application are to help you understand the idea of encapsulation and inheritance to help you eliminate code duplication.</p>
<p>If you were asked, ""Are all flowers plants?"", you would say... yes!</p>
<p>If you were asked, ""Are all trees plants?"", you would say... yes!</p>
<p>but what if you were asked, ""Are all flowers trees?"" or ""Are all trees flowers?"" you would obviously say... no!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of inheritance is that you can build a base (parent) class that holds all the attributes of its derived (child) class. Thus you wouldn't have to duplicate your code for objects that are both generic to flowers and trees.</p>

<h4>Walkthrough Video 1</h4>
<p><iframe style=""border: none;"" src=""https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/74dd4594-008d-4b35-8919-5ff69a1ab551?autoplay=false&amp;showinfo=true"" width=""640"" height=""360"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<h3>Step 2: Build a Base Class</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a new class in the project called Plant
<ul>
<li>Create public properties that identify ALL plants
<ul>
<li>Environment (string)</li>
<li>Type (string)</li>
<li>Name (string)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a constructor method
<ul>
<li>We will create a new plant every time it is called from the derived class. Thus we will need to pass in as parameters the name, environment, and type into the constructor method.</li>
<li>Next, set the default values to the backing fields to the parameters passed in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre>public Plant(string name, string environment, string type)<br>{<br>  _environment = environment;<br>  _type = type;<br>  _name = name;<br>}</pre>
<ul>
<li>We can now ask ourselves, ""Can I have a plant without creating it from a derived class?"" or in other words ""Is there such thing as a generic plant that doesn't come from a tree, flower, shrub, etc., etc.,?""... I would say no.
<ul>
<li>Thus, we can assume that we will never create a plant without creating it from a child class.</li>
<li>Therefore, we will need to make the class an abstract class. This means that a plant can only be created if it is created from a child class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add a method named Sniff and have it return a string. value of the smell of a plant. The derived classes will override this smell from the derived class.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>HINT: You may have a syntax error because a method cannot be generated in a base class if it is abstract and the method is not abstract. Thus we will need to make this method a ""virtual"" method. A virtual method means that you MUST override it from the derived class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 3: Build 3 Derived Classes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create three new classes (Tree, Flower, and Shrub)
<ul>
<li>Derive each class from the base (parent) class.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Add a constructor method that receives the name, environment, and type as parameters for each class.
<ul>
<li>pass the parameters into the base constructor method.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add a custom public property for each of the derived child) classes (e.g., public int TrunkSize { get; set; }).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each class will also need a public sniff method.
<ul>
<li>This method will be a string returning method that would return the reaction if the plant was sniffed.</li>
<li>For example, the Tree sniff method might return ""Cotton candy is my favorite tree smell"".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Walkthrough Steps 2 and 3</h4>
<p><iframe style=""border: none;"" src=""https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/3912a56d-4aac-4a15-859d-e40435c1e5d9?autoplay=false&amp;showinfo=true"" width=""640"" height=""360"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<h3>Step 4: Load default values</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the MainWindow.xaml.cs file, create a void returning method named LoadPlants
<ul>
<li>In the constructor method, call the new LoadPlants method.</li>
<li>Inside the new method, add code that populates the combo boxes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>CbEnvironment.Items.Add(""Desert"")</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 5: Plant Dictionary</h3>
<p>To store the plant selected, we will need to create a Dictionary that holds a key/value pair of a string (plant name) for the key and a Plant (all other properties) as the value pair. The dictionary should be placed in the class so it can be accessed throughout the class.</p>
<pre>Dictionary&lt;string, Plant&gt; plantsDict = new Dictionary&lt;string, Plant&gt;();</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 6: Add Plants Click Event</h3>
<p>When the add plants button is clicked, the system should validate the user's input to ensure that there is a plant name entered, a plant type is selected from the dropdown menu, and the plant environment is selected from its dropdown.</p>
<ul>
<li>The system should not break if one of these checks fails but instead should help the user fill out the information correctly.</li>
<li>Once all checks are successful, add a switch case that changes on the plant type. If it's a flower, create a new flower with the name, environment, and type entered.
<ul>
<li>Then, add the plant to the dictionary</li>
<li>Add the plant name to the Listbox so the user can then select it and see its details.</li>
<li>The switch-case should also have a default case that displays the error message in a message box:
<ul>
<li>body text - ""Unable to add the plant to the dictionary""&nbsp;</li>
<li>title text - ""Invalid Input""</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 7: Update Images</h3>
<p>Create a switch-case for each of the combo boxes that changes the image of the type if the type combo box is changed or the environment if the environment combo box is changed</p>
<p><iframe style=""border: none;"" src=""https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/49298f00-0919-4dd1-91ec-5e029e07800a?autoplay=false&amp;showinfo=true"" width=""640"" height=""360"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<h3>Step 8: Create the Plant Details Window</h3>
<p>Add a new window to the application and name it PlantDetailsWindow and add the following controls</p>
<p><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/547764/files/112187263/download?verifier=CtoeVmmamxPfHP7LKCxEGFdh1cZpgAdKhsu1ZHIl"" alt=""Plant Details Window with controls showing no results yet."" width=""546"" height=""256"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/547764/files/112187263"" data-api-returntype=""File""></p>
<h3>Step 9: Show Details Click Event</h3>
<p>The show details button will allow the user to select a stored plant and see its details. if no plant is selected, the system should not break, but instead should display a message to help the user select a stored plant first.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check to make sure a plant is selected from the Listbox before displaying the details.</li>
<li>Create a new instance of a plant object (Plant plant;).</li>
<li>Search the dictionary for the plant and use the value selected in the Listbox as the key.</li>
<li>If the value pair is found store it in the plant object.</li>
<li>Create a new method on the Plant details page named UpdatePlantDetails and pass the plant object in as a parameter<br>
<ul>
<li>Update each label from the plant class parameter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Show the plant details page as a modeless window</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Create the Landing Form</h3>
<ul>
<li>For this project we will learn how to connect to databases in THREE different ways:
<ul>
<li>A New database file (first few steps)</li>
<li>Existing database file with data already in it</li>
<li>Online database (hosted on UVU servers)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a landing form that has four buttons as shown below</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img role=""presentation"" src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/547764/files/112187085/download?verifier=le04YebsHWo8hZippnRhaMysWWjkGb1zwlhXJ9Do&amp;wrap=1"" alt="""" width=""689"" height=""453"" data-api-returntype=""File"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/547764/files/112187085""></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 3: Create a click event for the Local Phone Numbers button</h3>
<ul>
<li>Double-click the Local Phone Numbers button to create a click event.</li>
<li>We will connect this button up to a new form once we create it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 4: Add the database to the Data Sources Window</h3>
<ul>
<li>Once the file is added and the data is in the database, open the Data Sources window on the left (If not visible, you'll need to find it in the ""View"" dropdown menu and it is in the Other Windows section).</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 5: Create a Local Phone Numbers Form</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using the screenshot below, create a new form with the following controls
<ul>
<li>GroupBox for the Search</li>
<li>Label for the first name</li>
<li>TextBox for the search</li>
<li>Search button</li>
<li>Sort by Last Name button</li>

<ul>
<li>The top section is created from the data sources section.
<ul>
<li>Drag from the data sources the PhoneNumber table as a DataGridView onto the designer</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 6: Adding the Search Query</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add a new query to the dataset by going to the Data Sources window, right-click on the database, and select ""Edit DataSet with Designer""</li>
</ul>
<p><img style=""font-size: 1rem;"" role=""presentation"" src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/547764/files/112187132/download?verifier=6lCQ82NgtqyI02kpZBzWP1hJPsqi0p7QLIzZzcM9&amp;wrap=1"" alt="""" width=""604"" height=""348"" data-api-returntype=""File"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/547764/files/112187132""></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Create the SQL Query (notice the @value refers to the value being passed into the query. This will come from the textbox on the windows form.) Then click next</li>
</ul>
<pre>SELECT PhoneNumberId, FirstName, LastName, PhoneNumber, Age<br>FROM PhoneNumber<br>WHERE (FirstName LIKE '%' + @value + '%')</pre>

<ul>
<li>Make sure you unselect the ""Return a DataTable"" because we already have a DataTable we will be updating. Change the name of the Method name to ""FillByFirstNameSearch"" and then click finish.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 7: Call the new query</h3>
<ul>
<li>Now that you have the method built, we can call it from the Windows Form application and pass in the user's input to receive the data from the database.</li>
<li>To do this, you will need to create a click event for the search button. Then add this code inside it.</li>
</ul>
<pre>this.phoneNumberTableAdapter.FillByFirstNameSearch(this.phoneListDbDataSet.PhoneNumber, TxtBoxFirstName.Text);</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 8: Repeat for other queries</h3>
<p><strong>Follow the same steps to create a query for the Ages &gt; or = to 30 and the Sort by last name buttons.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 9:&nbsp;Next, do the same thing for the average age, but make sure to replace step 6 with ""SELECT which returns a single value"" when selecting the query type:</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 10: Debug</h3>
<ul>
<li>Once you have created all the code for the Form, please test it and make sure it functions as expected.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Update the database</h3>
<p>For this step, you'll need to update your database and add Entity Framework.</p>
<p>Because we are using an existing database (downloaded from part 2), you may find yourself wanting to update your code and add new columns of data.</p>
<p>When you imported your data file from part 2, it created a new Product.cs class. This class is your data model class that ""links"" to your database and manages the table structure. You will need to edit this file and add in a new column of data called ""Category"" which will be stored as a string.</p>
<p>Once you have done this complete the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the package manager console and type: enable-migrations
<ul>
<li>You may notice an error. This is because you added the database before adding the migrations. To fix this error, open the server explorer window and find the ProductDb database. Expand the database to find the Product table. Once there, right-click on the table and select ""Show table data"". Next copy all the data from the table, then delete the table.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Type in the package manager console again: enable-migrations</li>
<li>This will create a new Migrations folder in your solution explorer and will open a file. Set the AutomaticMigrations variable to true.</li>
<li>Type in the package manager console: update-database
<ul>
<li>This will recreate the table</li>
<li>Go to the Server Explorer window and refresh the tables in the database. Then right-click on the Product table and select show table data</li>
<li>Paste the data back in the table</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Update the table data by adding in the Category for each row of data
<ul>
<li>e.g., Shirt, Pants, Jacket</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><span id=""kl_banner_right"">MO6: Submit Participation 6 - Client / Server</span></h2>
<p>For this assignment, you will need to create a client application and a server application in the same solution. To do this, create<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>TWO</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>projects within<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>ONE</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>solution. For example, you could name your solution Assign6 and then name your client project ClientApplication and your server project ServerApplication.</p>
<p>This app will allow users to request a random joke or conspiracy from the server, and the server will then send back a response.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 2: Build the Client Application</h4>
<p>You will need to start the server application from the command line, while the client application can be started within Visual Studio. Figure 1 shows the GUI for the client application. The only new addition is the icon used on the form (upper left-hand corner). The icon is set using the Icon property of the form. You can create your own icon or use the one uploaded with the assignment.</p>
<p>The<span>&nbsp;</span><em>ReadOnly</em><span>&nbsp;</span>property on the textbox on the GUI should be set to true.&nbsp; The textbox is grayed out because it is<span>&nbsp;</span><em>ReadOnly</em>.&nbsp; Also, the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>WordWrap</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Multiline</em><span>&nbsp;</span>properties of the textbox should be set to true.&nbsp; The scrollbar appears due to the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Multiline</em><span>&nbsp;</span>property being set to true.</p>
<p>The GUI is separated into 2 sections by Group boxes (REQUEST and RESPONSE) as shown in Figure 1.&nbsp; There is a group box for the REQUEST information and a group box that displays the RESPONSE from the server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Step 3: Build the logic for the client</h4>
<p>Though you have not yet set up the server, the next step is to build the logic as if there was a server. This will require you to create a network stream that will send a request on a given IP address and port. You will need to build a class object named<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>SyncronousSocketClient.cs</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>that will handle the network reading and writing.</p>
<p><em>Watch the following video to help you build the client logic</em><em></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Step 4: Build a mockup of the server application</p>
<p>Before we build the server, you it may be advisable to build a mockup of the server. This may be a great approach to take first to ensure that the files you are reading for the jokes and conspiracies are loaded correctly. Download the jokes.txt and conspiracies.txt before you begin this section.</p>
<p><em>Watch the following video to help you complete the mockup of the server</em><em></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe style=""border: none;"" src=""https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/9f42a953-596b-4278-9e71-c8266765f4d9?autoplay=false&amp;showinfo=true"" width=""640"" height=""360"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<p>Step 5: Replace the Mockup Server with the Actual Server</p>
<p>Now that you have tested the server, it is time to build the connection between the server and the client. You will need to listen on the same IP Address and port number as the client so a request can be received and a response can be sent back. You will need to build a new class object in the server application called<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>SyncronousSocketListener.cs&nbsp;</strong>to build the logic.</p>
<p>The server must listen on port 11000 for a synchronous client connection.&nbsp; When the connection is established, the server must read the request text from the network stream.&nbsp; If the text sent equals ‘JOKE’, then the server must return a random joke.&nbsp; If the text equals ‘CONSPIRACY’ then the server must return a random conspiracy. If the client did not send the text ‘CONSPIRACY’ OR ‘JOKE’, then the server should just write back what text the client did send over.</p>
<p><em>Watch the following video to help you complete the server logic</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe style=""border: none;"" src=""https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/d2c40736-da36-4694-b3d3-7b08d30d9166?autoplay=false&amp;showinfo=true"" width=""640"" height=""360"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<p>Step 6: Test the Application</p>
<p>The server should be able to respond with a conspiracy theory, a joke, or just the echo back of the message sent to it.&nbsp; To get a joke back, send the server the text ‘JOKE’. To get a conspiracy theory, send the server the text ‘CONSPIRACY’.&nbsp; If neither joke nor conspiracy is sent to the server, the server will just echo back what it was sent. Figure 2 shows an example of the server response when the text ‘JOKE’ is sent to it.&nbsp; Figure 3 shows an example of the server response when the text ‘CONSPIRACY’ is sent to it.</p>

<p>Figure 3 – The server’s response to a conspiracy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The server code has more responsibility. The server must listen on port 11000 for a client request. The server is a console application.&nbsp; It is shown running in Figure 4.&nbsp; Figure 5 shows the server after receiving a JOKE request. Figure 6 shows the server after receiving a CONSPIRACY request.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the client does not request a JOKE or CONSPIRACY, then return the text that was passed to the server. Once the server acquires its appropriate response text, then it should WriteLine the response back to the client and the client should display the response in the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Multiline</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Textbox.</p>

<h2>OpenWeatherMap API Assignment</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this assignment is to help you as a student learn how to build a mobile application that interacts with an Application Program Interface (API). An API is a set of routines, protocols, and tools to help build application software that interacts with a given set of logical rules build by other developers. Most API requires an API key to interact with it so requests are tracked (mainly for security reasons). For example, Phillips Hue smart lights use an API (paired with a key) to send a request to change the color, brightness, and state (on/off) of the lights. This is accomplished by sending a request over a network and having the API do something with that request. OpenWeatherMap is another API that can be used to get the current temperature, weather conditions, and much more of a given city or location.</p>
<p>This project will have you use the OpenWeatherMap API to get the current weather data of a given city by having the user enter in the desired zip code. After the user provides the zip code, the API request will then return all of the weather conditions of that city and display it to the user on the mobile device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Task</h3>
<ol>
<li>Build a cross-platform application using Xamarin to interact with an API</li>
<li>Gain access to the OpenWeatherMap API by receiving an API key.</li>
<li>Requests will be sent to the OpenWeatherMap API</li>
<li>Responses from the OpenWeatherMap API will be received</li>
<li>The current weather of a given city will be displayed to the user</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Criteria</h3>
<p><em>Deliverables: </em>A mobile application that interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API.</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 1: &nbsp;Create a landing page that will receive the zip code from the user to produce the results page.</h3>
<p><strong>Just so you are aware - Visual Studio <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">NO LONGER has the preview window you see in the video</span>. You'll need to test it on the emulator or an Android device</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Step 2:&nbsp;Create an account with OpenWeatherMap and get your API key.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create an account:&nbsp;<a href=""https://openweathermap.org/api"">https://openweathermap.org/api(Links to an external site.)</a></li>
<li>Get your API Key. To do this, you will need to sign in and click on the API Key</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img role=""presentation"" src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/547764/files/112187217/download?verifier=PbLzAYHMvwSIaQwRuFvwXjot0WERFo9sAuZqNziy&amp;wrap=1"" alt="""" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/547764/files/112187217"" data-api-returntype=""File""></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Create the code to find the current weather for that city.</li>
<li>Read the API documentation (<a class=""instructure_file_link inline_disabled"" href=""https://openweathermap.org/api"" target=""_blank"">https://openweathermap.org/api</a><u>).</u>
<ul>
<li>In the “show current temp” button click event, get the current weather for that city.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>HINT: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=_____________</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe style=""border: none;"" src=""https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/95d2e158-28c1-4c28-9f54-1408582d6b7b?autoplay=false&amp;showinfo=true"" width=""640"" height=""360"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<h3>Step 3: Connect to the API using C#</h3>
<ul>
<li>In C#, you will need to use WebClient. This class can be accessed using the&nbsp;using&nbsp;System.Net;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Example Code:</em></p>
<pre>using (WebClient wc = new WebClient())<br>{<br>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wc.Headers[HttpRequestHeader.ContentType] =&nbsp;""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"";<br>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;string&nbsp;json = wc.DownloadString($""http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip={EntryZipCode.Text}&amp;appid={YOURAPIKEY}&amp;units=imperial"");<br>}&nbsp; &nbsp;</pre>
<ul>
<li>Create a try-catch block to get each value out of the JSON received.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>To process the JSON, you will need to store the values in JSON Objects. In C# this can be done using the JObject class (using&nbsp;Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;)</em></p>
<p><em>Example Code:</em></p>
<pre>JObject jo = JObject.Parse(json);<br><br>JObject main = JObject.Parse(jo[""main""].ToString());</pre>
<p><iframe style=""border: none;"" src=""https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/b3e2da83-d84e-48fd-b7d7-b67bfae34a9d?autoplay=false&amp;showinfo=true"" width=""640"" height=""360"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 4: Create a Global Variable class to store the values from the API</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a new class called WeatherGV.cs</li>
<li>Make the class static</li>
<li>Create 4 public static variables
<ul>
<li>public static string&nbsp;City {&nbsp;get;&nbsp;set; }</li>
<li>public static string&nbsp;CurTemp {&nbsp;get;&nbsp;set; }</li>
<li>public static string&nbsp;High {&nbsp;get;&nbsp;set; }</li>
<li>public static string&nbsp;Low {&nbsp;get;&nbsp;set; }</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Store the values in the new class variables</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Example Code:</em></p>
<pre>WeatherGV.CityName = jo[""name""].ToString();<br>WeatherGv.Temp = main[""temp""].ToString();</pre>
<p><iframe style=""border: none;"" src=""https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/1c7b2b43-3494-45e5-9d63-15c0f3bf2677?autoplay=false&amp;showinfo=true"" width=""640"" height=""360"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 5: Display the results on the new WeatherPage</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go to the App.xaml.cs page and update the code to look like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre>MainPage =&nbsp;new&nbsp;NavigationPage(new&nbsp;MainPage());</pre>
<ul>
<li>Update the new page by adding the values from the API in the labels on the page</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>StudentPhone table: How many times have we been over this in class?</p>
<p>PhoneTypeLookup table: Again how many times have we been over this in class?</p>
<p>Checkout: What should the primary key be? &nbsp;Students checkout books. &nbsp;This data will be recorded here. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Library would like to know check out date and check in date. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please include nice easy to read lines linking primary keys to foreign keys.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we discussed in class....For the inventory table, write ""view"" above the table.&nbsp; A view is stored sql.&nbsp; (We'll get to that later).&nbsp; For now, consider a view a table that is entirely dynamic - that is as an item is purchased for resale or sold to customers the inventory count will change automatically.&nbsp; Inventory for a particular item is after all the difference the amount purchased and the amount sold.</p>
<p>The inventory view will connect to salesItem and purchaseItem tables.&nbsp; In these tables you'll need price and quantity columns.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hint: SKU is what you want to use to describe an item.</p>
<p>Also you may want to use a compound primary key of PONUM, PO_Item for purchaseItems table &amp; InvoiceNum, ItemNum for saleItem table.</p>
<p>Remember: You can design the ERD however you think best.&nbsp; There are many ways to skin a cat, however, the design must work.&nbsp; That is, it must model Vince's processes.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,25.0,['online_upload'],1929556

<p class=""Exercise"">2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Database: AP</p>
<p class=""Exercise"">Write a SELECT statement that returns four columns from the Invoices table, named Number, Total, Credits, and Balance:&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Exercise"">Number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column alias for the InvoiceNumber column</p>
<p class=""Exercisedetail"">Total&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column alias for the InvoiceTotal column</p>
<p class=""Exercise"">Credits&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sum of the PaymentTotal and CreditTotal columns</p>
<p class=""Exercise"">Balance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; InvoiceTotal minus the sum of PaymentTotal and CreditTotal</p>
<p class=""Exercisesub"">a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the AS keyword to assign column aliases.</p>
<p class=""Exercise"">3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Database: AP</p>
<p class=""Exercise"">Write a SELECT statement that returns one column from the Vendors table named Full Name. Create this column from the VendorContactFName and VendorContactLName columns. Format it as follows: last name, comma, first name (for example, “Doe, John”). Sort the result set by last name, then by first name.</p>
<p class=""Exercise"">4.&nbsp;Database: AP &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Exercise"">Write a SELECT statement that returns three columns:</p>
<p class=""Exercisedetail"">InvoiceTotal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Invoices table</p>
<p class=""Exercisedetail"">10%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10% of the value of InvoiceTotal</p>
<p class=""Exercisedetail"">Plus 10%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The value of InvoiceTotal plus 10%</p>
<p class=""Exercise"">(For example, if InvoiceTotal is 100.0000, 10% is 10.0000, and Plus 10% is 110.0000.) Only return those rows with a balance due greater than 1000. Sort the result set by InvoiceTotal, with the largest invoice first.</p>
<p class=""Exercise"">5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Database: AP</p>
<p class=""Exercise"">Modify the solution to exercise 2a to filter for invoices with an InvoiceTotal that’s greater than or equal to $500 but less than or equal to $10,000.</p>

<p>1. Write a CREATE VIEW statement that defines a view named InvoiceBasic that returns three columns: VendorName, InvoiceNumber, and InvoiceTotal. Then, write a SELECT statement that returns all of the columns in the view, sorted by VendorName, where the first letter of the vendor name is N, O, or P.</p>
<p>2. Create a view named Top10PaidInvoices that returns three columns for each vendor: VendorName, LastInvoice (the most recent invoice date), and SumOfInvoices (the sum of the InvoiceTotal column). Return only the 10 vendors with the largest SumOfInvoices and include only paid invoices.</p>
<p>3. Create an updatable view named VendorAddress that returns the VendorID, both address columns, and the city, state, and zip code columns for each vendor. Then, write a SELECT query to examine the result set where VendorID=4. Next, write an UPDATE statement that changes the address so that the suite number (Ste 260) is stored in VendorAddress2 rather than in VendorAddress1. To verify the change, rerun your SELECT query.</p>
<p>4. Write a SELECT statement that selects all of the columns from the catalog view that returns information about foreign keys. How many foreign keys are defined in the AP database?</p>
<p>Ch 14 Stored Procedures and Triggers</p>
<p>1. Create a stored procedure named spInvoiceReport that selects the VendorName, InvoiceNumber, and InvoiceTotal of the unpaid invoices sorted by VendorName.</p>
<p>2. Create a stored procedure named spCopyInvoices that copies the invoices table into a new table named InvoiceCopy, and first drops InvoiceCopy if it already exists.</p>
<p class=""Exercise"">3. Create a trigger for the Vendors table that will print the message ""New Vendor Added"" when a row is inserted into the Vendors table.&nbsp; Create a test statement and test the trigger.</p>
<p class=""Exercise"">4. Create a trigger for the Invoices table that automatically inserts the vendor name and address for a paid invoice into a table named ShippingLabels. The trigger should fire for an insert or update operation, but a row should be added to the ShippingLabels table only if the invoice balance due is zero. The structure of the ShippingLabels table is as follows:</p>
<p class=""Exercisecode"">CREATE TABLE ShippingLabels</p>
<p class=""Exercisecode"">(VendorName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; varchar(50),</p>
<p class=""Exercisecode"">&nbsp;VendorAddress1&nbsp;&nbsp; varchar(50),</p>
<p class=""Exercisecode"">&nbsp;VendorAddress2&nbsp;&nbsp; varchar(50),</p>
<p class=""Exercisecode"">&nbsp;VendorCity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; varchar(50),</p>
<p class=""Exercisecode"">&nbsp;VendorState&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; char(2),</p>
<p class=""Exercisecodelast"">&nbsp;VendorZipCode&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; varchar(20))</p>
<p class=""Exercise"">Use this UPDATE statement to test the trigger:</p>
<p class=""Exercisecode"">UPDATE Invoices</p>
<p class=""Exercisecode"">SET PaymentTotal = 67.92, PaymentDate = '2008-08-23'</p>
<p class=""Exercisecodelast"">WHERE InvoiceID = 100</p>
<p class=""Exercisecodelast"">5. Create a copy of the vendors table. Add a new column to the vendors_copy table named YTD Purchases with money data type.&nbsp; Create a trigger for the vendors_copy table that will add the invoicetotal for each inserted row of the invoices table to the YTDPurchases colum of the vendors_copy table.&nbsp; Create a couple of test statements adding a row in Invoices to test the trigger.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,15.0,['online_upload'],1929556

<p>When brainstorming iPhone Apps it is sometimes helpful to look at other apps already developed. The best way to check out other apps is on the iTunes store (iTunes is free).</p>
<p>Start a blank slides presentation using Microsoft PowerPoint only.&nbsp; This is one slide show.&nbsp; Have a title page at the start with the app name and list all members of the group.&nbsp; &nbsp;Separate each of the following sections with a title page.&nbsp; &nbsp;Using a 12 point font, complete the App Description section using complete sentences and paragraphs.&nbsp; Change Master Slide background.&nbsp; The presentation should contain at least 12 slides: App Description-5, As-Is To-Be-2, Mock-up-5 or more.</p>
<p><strong>App Description</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In one or more paragraphs describe the situation or problem that your app is designed to address. Note that you are not limited by technological constraints. Your app can have superpowers.</li>
<li>In one or more paragraphs describe your solution to the situation or problem.</li>
<li>In one or more paragraphs list at least three benefits that your solution will provide. You may use bullets.</li>
<li>Describe three market segments that would buy your app—one of which must be your classmates. Provide demographics for the market segments—e.g., age, education, household income, gender, geographic location, and so forth.</li>
<li>Now pick one of those segments and create a fictional persona in the target market. Tell us details about your persona—where they live, how much they earn, where they go on vacation, if they have a girlfriend/boyfriend, and so forth. Remember that your persona must be willing to buy the app.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DEMONSTRATE THE BENEFITS OF YOUR APP - As-Is and To-Be Process</strong></p>
<p>By creating As-Is and To-Be process flow diagrams, you will be able to analyze the benefits of the app. Here you show us how your persona engages in a business process with, and without, your app. The app should build a strong case that the To-Be process is a significant improvement over the as-is version. Create both the As-Is and the To-Be process flow diagrams of the use of the iPhone app. The As-Is diagrams should model how the persona performs the task without the app. The To-Be diagram will describe how the task is completed using the app.</p>
<p>Here is a link to give you an idea about the As-Is and To-Be process:</p>

<p>Setup</p>
<p>Content and Style</p>
<ul>
<li>Create each process diagram on separate slides.</li>
<li>Use a combination of drawing shapes (lines, arrows, etc.) and text.</li>
<li>Use design principles to maximize professionalism.</li>
<li>Label each diagram with an appropriate title.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CREATE A MOCKUP OF YOUR APP</strong></p>
<p>In this assignment you will create an iPhone app mockup based on your analysis. This mockup acts as a visual model to use in a product proposal. Using the templates provided, design a creative and useful iPhone app. You may use any tool you wish to complete this step of the project. A list of tools is included in this<span>&nbsp;</span><span class=""ally-file-link-holder link_holder""><span class=""instructure_file_holder link_holder instructure_file_link_holder ally-file-link-holder""><a id="""" class=""file_preview_link previewable"" title=""Mock Ups and Wireframes.pdf"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/534854/files/110089908/download?wrap=1"" target="""" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/534854/files/110089908"" data-api-returntype=""File"" data-id=""110089908"" aria-expanded=""false"" aria-controls=""preview_1"">document</a></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Content and Style</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an original mockup.</li>
<li>Create an icon for your app with an appropriate logo on the first slide.</li>
<li>Include all of the necessary images.</li>
<li>Create separate presentation&nbsp;pages to simulate the app in action.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Include your name as the wireless carrier instead of AT&amp;T (in upper left corner).</li>

Select an issue that you are familiar with--this could be in your workplace, or in your personal or social life. Create an outline of all six steps of CRISP-DM, starting with Business/Organizational Understanding and concluding with Deployment. List activities and events in each of the six sections that would need to occur in addressing your chosen topic. For example, in data understanding, what data would you need to get and where would you get it? Before you do any data preparation, you're going to need to answer data understanding questions. So be specific in each of the sections about what you would do and how you would do it, with the end goal being an outline that could be executed to address your chosen topic. You do not have to actually gather or analyze data for this hybrid activity; the objective here is to help you think through the six step process to planning an analytic activity. Subsequently, for Deployment, you can simply describe how you would deploy your results rather than trying to develop an actual deployment.</p>
<p>Write up your outline in a Word document. Use standard outlining formatting to present your information.

<p><a href=""https://www.data.gov/"">https://www.data.gov/</a></p>
<p>Download your chosen data set and open it on your computer. This may take a bit of work, depending on which data set you select. If you find a CSV or Excel file, it will make this assignment much easier.</p>
<p>Complete a Business Understanding and Data Understanding analysis of your data. Write a 1-2 page summary of your assessment of your data. Ensure that address all of the following points:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) What types of businesses or organizations would use the data set you selected.</p>
<p>2) List at least three questions that organizations could/would answer using your chosen data set. Explain why each of these three questions would matter; why an organization would care about the answers to your stated questions.</p>
<p>3) Conduct basic descriptive analysis on your data set. Describe any metadata that came with your data set.</p>
<p>4) Discuss the value of the variables included. Are there questions or ambiguities associated with any of the variables?</p>
<p>5) Examine the data for outliers. Identify and discuss any that you find. Determine if there are any interesting anomalies in the data.</p>
<p>In your written submission, be sure to enumerate and label each of the five sections above. Submit both your chosen data set and your written assessment of it by the due date.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This data set contains information collected by MachSteel, Inc., a company that manufactures high-quality steel gears for industrial machinery. Each custom gear the company produces is examined twice, first in its “rough” state, when it has first emerged from the production process, and again in its “polished” state after it has been smoothed, coated and is ready for shipment. Because there are various finishing processes, it is possible for any given gear’s measurements in its polished state to be slightly higher than its measurements in its rough state.</p>
<p>Each gear is uniquely identified by an ItemID, and eight additional attributes are recorded:</p>
<ul>
<li>TestState: The indicator of whether the gear was in its rough or polished state when the rest of the attributes were recorded.</li>
<li>UnitType: The measurement units used for the gear—either Metric or US units.</li>
<li>SurfaceArea: The total surface areas of the gear, measured in the relevant unit type.</li>
<li>StructuralIntegrity: A numeric measurement between 1 and 40, representing the gear’s structural soundness when examined microscopically. The higher the number, the more sound the gear’s metal.</li>
<li>Diameter: The distance across the gear from edge to edge, measured in the relevant unit type.</li>
<li>Circumference: The distance around the outer edge of the gear, measured in the relevant unit type.</li>
<li>Volume: The amount of liquid measured in the relevant unit type that the gear would hold if it were an empty vessel.</li>
<li>Weight: The weight of the gear measured in the relevant unit type.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data Preparation in RapidMiner</strong></p>
<p>Complete the following steps and then answer the exercise questions below.</p>
<p>Step 1. In RapidMiner, either import the data set for this exercise into a repository, or read the data from the CSV source file using a Read CSV operator.</p>
<p>Step 2: Using the appropriate RapidMiner operator, filter out any observations (examples) where the diameter is unknown (UNK).</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,10.0,['online_quiz'],1929556

So for this hybrid activity, I want you to engage in using CRISP-DM. Complete the following steps:</p>
<p>1) Think of a problem or question that you have encountered in your life that could be helped or solved through the use of data analysis. Write a one-paragraph explanation of the problem/question. Label this Business (or Organizational) Understanding. Be succinct and clear in describe what the problem/question is and how data analysis would help you address it.</p>
<p>2) Think of the data that you would need in order to address your chosen problem/question. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>List, label and describe each of the following</strong></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where would you get the needed data? (Business systems? Surveys? Observation? Instruments?)</li>
<li>How much data would you need? (Think in terms of both time and magnitude)</li>
<li>What mechanism(s) would you use to collect the data?</li>
<li>What barriers to data collection might exist?</li>
<li>Are there data security/privacy concerns, and if so, how would you address these?</li>
<li>How would you recommend organizing and storing the data?</li>
<li>What business unit would be charged with managing the data?</li>
<li>Are the issues of time associated with your data? That is, as the data ages, would it need to be purged, updated, etc.?</li>
</ul>
<p>Be&nbsp; sure that your responses are substantive and meaningful. Be thoughtful and try to approach this hybrid activity as if it were a work assignment for a job. A cursory or shallow treatment of your chosen topic would not reflect well on you professionally; and likewise, would not result in a very good score on this HA assignment. There is no minimum page requirement, because I am looking for quality over quantity. As a guide however, I would suggest that if you don't write at least one, single-spaced page of content to address the questions above, you're probably not addressing a legitimate business problem or question with enough detail.</p>

<p>This data set contains information about a wide range of cars. You will create a correlation matrix (use the default Pearson correlation algorithm) and then answer some questions about how the attributes relate to one another, if at all. The interpretation of the attributes is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>MPG: The car's tested fuel economy in miles per gallon of fuel.</li>
<li>Cylinders: The number of cylinders each vehicle's engine has. More cylinders usually equates to more power produced by an engine.</li>
<li>Engine_Size: A measurement of how big the cylinders are. For this data set, Engine_Size is measured in cubic inches.</li>
<li>Horse_Power: A measurement of how much power the engine is capable of producing.</li>
<li>Vweight: How much the vehicle weighs in pounds.</li>
<li>Acceleration: The number of seconds the vehicle takes to go from 0 to 60 miles per hour.</li>

<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;HYBRID ACTIVITY</h2>
<p>To complete this hybrid activity, open an Excel spreadsheet and create seven columns for information about universities:</p>
<ul>
<li>University Name</li>
<li>Graduation Rate</li>
<li>Average Cost</li>
<li>Median Earnings</li>
<li>Fields of Study</li>
<li>Median Debt</li>
<li>Undergraduate Population</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add other numeric attributes of the universities if you wish (e.g. University Age), but be sure to at least include the seven attributes listed above.</p>
<p>Using the U.S. Department of Education's<span>&nbsp;</span><a class=""inline_disabled external"" href=""https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/"" target=""_blank""><span>College Scorecard web site</span><span class=""screenreader-only"">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a>, look up the values for each of these attributes for<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>at least 20 different universities</strong></span>. Pick some local and some national universities so that you have some variability in your data.</p>
<p>Connect to your spreadsheet in RapidMiner or RStudio and use correlations, scatterplots, and k-means clustering to see if you can identify two or more clusters of universities, across the attribute dimensions listed above. The intent of this hybrid activity is to allow you to be exploratory, so there is no right or wrong solution to your analysis, but it should be thoughtful. Use screenshots, scatterplots, graphs, or charts to compare and contrast the attributes of the universities you selected.</p>
<p>Prepare a report summarizing your main findings. In writing, explain which universities clustered together based upon the outputs of the various analytical methods you apply to your data.</p>

An agent gathers data about you, puts it into a predictive system, and the model puts you into a risk category which in turn determines your premiums.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/"">Read this article</a>, which lists 15 variables that are used to categorize auto insurance buyers. Then in Excel create a mock up data set containing all 15 of these variables, and four observations. The four observations should contain values that would lead to one of four pricing categorizations: Best Rate, Discounted Rate, No Discount Rate, or High Risk Rate. As you create your example data set, the values you assign in each of the 15 columns should be representative of values that would place an insurance customer into the rate category for that row. For example, one of the 15 variables given in the article is ""Years of Driving Experience"", so for the observation you create to represent ""High Risk Rate"" you could put a 1 or a 2, while for the ""Best Rate"" observation, you could put 20. Also, be thoughtful about each of the variable as you consider what values would be appropriate. The article indicates that for the ""Location"" variable, Michigan would be a higher rate than Ohio, but then it goes on to state that rates are usually influenced at the ZIP code level rather than the state level. So a Location value with a Detroit ZIP code would probably map to the ""High Risk Rate"" observation, while a Location ZIP code in Traverse City would be more likely to be ""Best Rate"" or ""Discounted Rate"", and Ann Arbor's ZIP code would probably be somewhere in between the two.</p>
<p>Create a merged cell in your Excel document below your example records where you can explain, thoroughly, in writing why you put certain values in each of the columns to make each record track to that row's category.</p>

<p>These data sets contain information about farm crop damage related to drought conditions. The training data set contains 151 observations. The training observations are compiled from past growing seasons on farms that have been monitored for several years, to account for variable drought conditions in the same location over time. Based on the training data, you will predict the drought-related crop damage risk in the upcoming year for 462 farms in the scoring data set. The data in the scoring data set contains values for the attributes collected just prior to planting for the upcoming growing season. Your model will help farmers anticipate the level of drought-related crop damage risk they face based on the attributes observed at their farm as they prepare to plant. The scoring data set contains all of the same attributes as the training data set, except for the CropDamage dependent variable.</p>
<p>The attributes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>PrevYrDrought: A binary field indicating that the farm did (1) or did not (0) experience drought conditions during its growing season the prior year.</li>
<li>SoilMoisture: A numeric measure of the farm’s consistent soil moisture level throughout the prior year’s growing season. The higher the number, the more water in the soil.</li>
<li>GroundWater: A numeric measure of the farm’s amount of groundwater and access to it. Taken on the first day of the growing season. The higher the number, the more water available to the farm.</li>
<li>Plantings: The normal number of crop plantings the farm does each growing season. Each farm does either 1 or 2 plantings each growing season.</li>
<li>WindyDays: The number of days during the prior year’s growing season where winds persisted for more than two hours at high enough average speeds to contribute to drying crops and/or soil.</li>
<li>CropDamage: Present only in the training data set, this is one of four categorical values: No Damage, Mild, Moderate or Severe. For each growing season at the farms in the training data, farmers reported the amount of drought-related crop damage, ranging from negligible crop losses in the best years, to severe losses in years where drought conditions catastrophically damaged 75% or more of the farmer’s crops. Mild damage is limited to less than 25% of a growing season’s crops, while moderate damage would be 25% to 75% of the farmer’s crops.</li>

<p>These data sets contain information about the strength of concrete slabs. Strength of materials is a critical aspect of civil engineering which ensures that anything that is constructed—houses, buildings, roads, etc.—are safe and durable. You will use measurements in one-cubic-meter concrete mixtures to predict the compressive strength of concrete slabs.</p>
<p>Note: The copyrighted data sets in these exercises are used by permission of Professor I-Cheng Yeh.<br>I-Cheng Yeh, ""Modeling of strength of high performance concrete using artificial neural networks,"" Cement and Concrete Research, Vol. 28, No. 12, pp. 1797-1808 (1998).</p>
<p>The attributes in the data are:</p>
<ul>
<li>SlabID: A non-predictive random number that unique identifies each concrete slab.</li>
<li>Cement: The amount of Portland cement in kilograms.</li>
<li>Slag: The amount of blast furnace slag (ore refining byproduct) in kilograms.</li>
<li>Fly Ash: The amount of fly ash (coal furnace byproduct) in kilograms.</li>
<li>Water: The amount of water added to the mixture. Though liquid, it is measured in kilograms in this data set.</li>
<li>Superplasticizer: A liquid chemical compound added to the mixture to add flexible strength to the concrete. Though liquid, it is measured in kilograms in this data set.</li>
<li>Coarse aggregate: The amount of gravel in kilograms.</li>
<li>Fine aggregate: The amount of sand, lime and/or silica in kilograms.</li>
<li>Age: The age in days that the concrete slab had cured at the time it was tested.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compressive Strength: The dependent variable (or label), present only in the training data. It is calculated by breaking concrete slabs in a testing lab. The failure load (breaking point) is divided by the area of the slab that resisted the test load. The number listed is units of pound-force per square inch (psi)—the higher the number, the stronger the concrete.</p>
<p><strong>Linear Regression in RStudio</strong></p>
<p>Complete the following steps and then answer the exercise questions below.</p>
<p>Step 1: Import the training and scoring data sets for this exercise into data frames in RStudio.</p>
<p>Step 2: Load the R library required to create a linear regression model.</p>
<p>Step 3: Create a linear regression model to predict CompressiveStrength. Do not include SlabID as an independent variable. Use the summary() function to inspect your independent variables’ p-Values. Remove independent variables, if any, that do not strictly meet the alpha level (0.05). Re-create your model and inspect it using summary() to ensure that all independent variables are now statistically significant.</p>
<p>Step 4: Using a subset() command, remove observations, if any, from the scoring data set where one or more attributes exceed the range established in the training data set. For example, the range for Water in the training data set is 121.800 to 247. If any observations in the scoring data set have Water values below 121.800 or above 247, remove them. Check all attributes to ensure all scoring observations are within ranges established by the training data.</p>
<p>Step 5: Using the predict() function, apply your linear regression model to the scoring data.</p>
<p>Step 6: Combine the predictions with the scoring data into a new data frame.

Create a binary column called Survival Status, and use a formula in Excel to populate this column with ""Lived"" or ""Died"". This will be your dependent variable for a logistic regression model. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>If a person has a value in the Lifeboat column, then that person lived.

Once your formula correctly lists each person's survival status, replace the formula with the Lived/Died values (copy &gt; paste special &gt; values), and then <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>make sure you delete the Lifeboat and Body columns</strong></span>. If you don't do this, your logistic regression model will not work.</p>
<p>Create a scoring data set containing the same columns that are in the Titanic Passengers data set, but do not include a Survival Status column. You will predict this using your trained logistic regression model. Add yourself and at least 19 other people. These can be real people or made up people, but you should put in values for things like passenger class that would be realistic. For example, your illustrious instructor always flies on the cheapest airline ticket available. On the Titanic, Prof would have been in 3rd class, no doubt. Run your model to generate predictions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These data sets contain information about patrons of a local live theater company. You will use historical season ticket subscriber data to train a logistic regression model, and then predict the likelihood of renewal for 148 new season ticket holders who have just completed their first season as patrons of the theater.</p>
<p>The attributes in the data are:</p>
<ul>
<li>PatronID: A random, non-predictive identification number assigned to each season ticket holder.</li>
<li>RenewedSubscription: The dependent variable found only in the training data, coded as ‘Yes’—the patron renewed their season tickets following a prior season—or ‘No’—the patron did not renew their season tickets following a prior season.</li>
<li>PricePerTicket: The total whole dollar amount paid for the number of performances attended. A patron who paid $68 to attend six performances has paid $6.80 per ticket, per performance. Individual show prices are affected by the number of tickets a patron purchases, and the number of performances they attend.</li>
<li>NumberOfTickets: The number of season tickets purchased by the patron. A person who paid $68 per ticket and who has ‘2’ under NumberOfTickets paid $136 for their season tickets. A person who paid $66 per ticket and has a ‘4’ under NumberOfTickets paid $264 for their season tickets.</li>
<li>DifferentUsers: Any person can use a patron’s season tickets, so the theater keeps track of how many different individuals use one patron’s tickets. A patron who purchases two season tickets and shows two different users always had the same two people use their tickets. Whereas a person who purchases two season tickets and has eight different users has allowed several different individuals to attend performances throughout the season using their tickets.</li>
<li>ConcessionVouchers: This is the number of optional add-on vouchers the season ticket holder purchased. These are redeemable for drinks and snacks at the theater before and after the show, and during intermission.</li>
<li>AvgMinutesBeforeCurtain: This is the number of minutes before the start of each show that each patron’s tickets were scanned by the usher who seated them. If a patron were to arrive at 7:15 PM for each 7:30 PM performance, their AvgMinutesBeforeCurtain value would be 15. Patrons with a negative value in this variable were usually late and entered the theater after the show began.</li>
<li>PerformancesAttended: This is the number of shows selected by each patron. Season ticket options allow patrons to purchase tickets to as few as four shows and as many as nine in any given season.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Logistic Regression in RapidMiner</strong></p>
<p>Complete the following steps and then answer the exercise questions below.</p>
<p>Step 1: In RapidMiner, either import the training and scoring data sets for this exercise into a repository, or read the data from the CSV source files using Read CSV operators. Ensure that the RenewedSubscription attribute’s data type is binominal.</p>
<p>Next, using the appropriate RapidMiner operators for each step:</p>
<p>Step 2: Set the RenewedSubscription attribute in the training data set to the role of Label.</p>
<p>Step 3: Ensure that the PatronID fields with be retained in the data sets, but <strong><u>not</u></strong> used as independent variables in the model, as they are randomly assignment numbers and are not predictive of subscription renewal.</p>
<p>Step 4: Remove observations, if any, from the scoring data set where one or more attributes exceed the range established in the training data set. For example, the range for DifferentUsers in the training data set is 2 to 12. If any observations in the scoring data set have DifferentUsers values below 2 or above 12, remove them. Check all attributes to ensure all scoring observations are within ranges established by the training data.</p>
<p>Step 5: Add a Logistic Regression operator. Accept the default parameters.</p>
<p>Step 6: Apply the model to the scoring data set. Output both the model and the label predictions. Run the process. Do not remove any independent variables from the model. Examine the model’s output, then answer the following questions.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,10.0,['online_quiz'],1929556

Although the video does not give details about specific analytics that may have been used to identify high risk borrowers, it does illustrate what unscrupulous lenders can do when they are able to use data to find victims to exploit. Many organizations have done, and continue to do exactly this.</p>
<p>Having seen this case, I would like you to find your own example of an abusive analytics incident and share a summary of it with me. This could be in video form, like mine was, or it could be a web page, article or document. It does not need to address lending or finance--it can be any example where analytics was used in an abusive, unethical, irresponsible, or otherwise problematic way.</p>
<p>Write a description of the incident, and answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Who were the targets of the abusive analytics practice?</p>
<p>2. What were the consequences of the incident, both for the targets and for the perpetrator (if any)?</p>
<p>3. How could the targets have protected themselves against this practice?</p>
<p>4. Is the practice still going on, either by the perpetrator identified in your case, or by others who have adopted the practice?</p>

<p>These data sets contain information about loan applicants at a bank. You will use data from past loans to predict the bank’s risk when lending to new applicants. All of the loans represented in the training data set are closed, and the bank has classified their risk retrospectively.</p>
<p>The attributes in the data are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ApplicantID: A random, non-predictive identification number assigned to each loan applicant.</li>
<li>Credit_Score: The applicant’s FICO credit score. Scores on the FICO scale range from 300 (not credit-worthy) to 850 (perfect credit). The higher the credit score, the lower the risk.</li>
<li>Late_Payments: The number of times in the past seven years that the applicant has been more than 90 days delinquent on any open line of credit.</li>
<li>Months_In_Job: The number of months the person has been working at their current job.</li>
<li>Debt_Income_Ratio: The applicant’s total monthly debt payments divided by their gross monthly income. Lending standards vary, but most banks consider about 33% or less to be a positive debt-to-income ratio. Ratios greater than this increase risk of default. Values in this exercise’s data sets are presented as percentages, rounded to one decimal place.</li>
<li>LoanAmt: The total amount in US dollars the applicant asked to borrow.</li>
<li>Liquid_Assets: The total amount in US dollars the applicant has in cash, bank accounts (savings, checking), or other forms that can be converted to cash in less than 24 business hours.</li>
<li>Num_Credit_Lines: The total number of lines of credit the applicant currently has open, including credit cards, mortgages or other loans.</li>
<li>Credit_Risk: The dependent variable to be predicted for each new loan applicant, classifying them into one of five categories: Very Low, Low, Moderate, High, or DO NOT LEND. The bank uses these categories to determine which applicants will receive their loans, and under what terms.</li>

<p>On the midterm exam, you answered a few questions about how Coca-Cola could use data to improve its supply chain, marketing, and operations management. You have since learned a number of ways to build predictive models. Using the data sets supplied on Canvas, construct a basic forecast for the prices of crude oil (essential for plastic manufacturing), aluminum, corn, and sugar.</p>
<p>Consider using all of the analytic techniques you have learned this semester: descriptive statistics, correlation, regression, cluster analysis, decision trees, neural networks. Do not assume that the data is already formatted optimally for any given technique. Part of your challenge in this activity is connect the various techniques and concepts you've learned to solve a real business problem, without specific preconceived outcomes or processes. Consider how you might format the data to evaluate fluctuations in prices for days of the week, months, or seasons, and year-over-year. Do the commodity prices track with Coca-Cola's finished product prices in any consistently observable way? When do you recommend the company buy these commodities, and why?</p>
<p>Prepare a report of your analysis. Document your analysis of the data thoroughly. Since your analysis will be unique from everyone else's, it is important that your submission tells me your story--how did you prepare, assess, model, predict, and interpret the data?</p>

<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<p>This exam is for you to demonstrate what you have learned. The exam is <strong>OPEN</strong> book, notes, web, and prior assignments. <strong>NO ChatGPT</strong>. You need to use Chrome as your browser for Proctorio to work.</p>
<ol>
<li>This exam is to test your knowledge only. No one else should be in the room, nor assisting you in any manner. You will be monitored by Proctorio.</li>
<li>Make sure you are in Chrome.</li>
<li>Login to the campus Virtual Private Network (VPN).</li>
<li>Login to your Virtual Machine (VM) so you can access prior assignments and a familiar development environment.</li>
<li>Launch Proctorio (Notice this is after logging onto the campus VPN).</li>
<li>Take the exam.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Login your VM before launching Proctorio. Proctorio works best if you log in into your VM first.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span>If you can see this page, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>your Proctorio plugin is working</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p><span>This course will require you to use Proctorio for both exams. Proctorio is a remote exam proctoring service which will monitor your computer's web camera, microphone and computer screen <em><strong>while you are taking the test</strong>.</em> Teachers can view those sessions after you have submitted the test. </span></p>
<p><span>This is a practice quiz to help you setup Proctorio on your computer. Proctorio is a Google Chrome extension so Chrome is required. <strong>This test will not work on Safari, Firefox or Edge</strong>.&nbsp; You will have unlimited attempts so you can ensure Proctorio works in your chosen testing location.</span></p>
<div>UVU has provided several resources on their <a href=""https://www.uvu.edu/otl/students/exam_proctoring.html"">Exam Proctoring</a> website<em>&nbsp;</em>to help you become familiar with Proctorio. Please review the Student Proctorio Guide and the orientation video prior to taking this practice quiz to learn how to set up your testing environment.</div>
<p><span>If Proctorio isn't working on your computer please refer to the Proctorio Troubleshooting Chart on the <a href=""https://www.uvu.edu/otl/students/exam_proctoring.html"">UVU Exam Proctoring </a>page.</span></p>

Do your own work. Do <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">not</span> </strong>compare with other students' work.</p>
<p>Your steering committee needs to use a WSM (Weighted Ranking Matrix) to rate four IT projects for selection consideration. Use Excel to create a WSM for the criteria, weights, scores, and totals. Here is a bit of start-file: <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled"" title=""WeightedScoringModelAsg.xlsx"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/570160/files/118108479?verifier=a4lCOZrbnVFshavllyolgMMJeuognhQo4l9UwjsH&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/570160/files/118108479"" data-api-returntype=""File"">WeightedScoringModelAsg.xlsx</a></p>
<p>The committee decided on these criteria and their respective weights:</p>
<ul>
<li>25% net present value (NPV)</li>
<li>15% return on investment (ROI)</li>
<li>15% risk</li>
<li>20% strategic plan alignment</li>
<li>15% competition</li>
<li>10% resource availability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assume these NPVs:<br>Project 1: $3,640<br>Project 2: $62,360<br>Project 3: $101,270<br>Project 4: $52,820</p>
<p>Assume these ROIs:<br>Project 1: 2.92%<br>Project 2: 81.9%<br>Project 3: 44.5%<br>Project 4: 47.5%</p>
<p>These are the risks assigned to the projects:<br>Project 1: Very High<br>Project 2: Medium<br>Project 3: Medium<br>Project 4: Low</p>
<p>Project alignment with the organization's strategic plan:<br>Project 1: Strong<br>Project 2: Strong<br>Project 3: Moderate<br>Project 4: Moderate</p>
<p>Need for the project based on competition:<br>Project 1: Low<br>Project 2: Low<br>Project 3: High<br>Project 4: Very High</p>
<p>Resource availability (rating of what resources available to develop the IT solution):<br>Project 1: Good<br>Project 2: Good<br>Project 3: Poor<br>Project 4: Poor</p>
<p>Create the point system (e.g., 1-5, 1-7, or 1-10 where 1 is the lowest rating) and list this scale on the worksheet. Use descriptive labels and insert formulas to calculate the weighted values and totals. Note that for the critera scores of words such as Good and Poor you will have to create a scale mapped to the words and use the numbers in the calculations (you can't multiply a text word). Apply appropriate label and number formatting to enhance the worksheet</p>
<p>Answer these questions below the worksheet data:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you can select only one project, which one should it be and why?</li>
<li>If you can select two projects, what two projects should be selected?</li>
<li>What factors contributed the most to the lowest-rated project not being selected?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;Save the Excel workbook in this format: &lt;Your Last Name&gt;_WSM.xslx, using your last name, and then upload it to Canvas.</p>

<li><strong>Project</strong>:&nbsp;<span>When you enter the values in the&nbsp;<strong>Predecessors </strong>column, you must use the row corresponding row numbers.</span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Project</strong>: Adjust column widths.</li>
<li><strong>Project</strong>: Enter these 2023-2024 holidays: New Years Day and Martin Luther King Day, President's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Pioneer Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.</li>
<li><strong>Project</strong>: Save the file in this syntax: <strong>YourTeamProject_Asg3_EstimationGantt</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Project</strong>: Display a&nbsp;Gantt chart&nbsp;to display the critical path.&nbsp;</li>

<p>Think about the following scenario and answer the questions below.</p>
<p>Each hour, a list of patients who are receiving medications stored in a pharmacy database is automatically queried against a laboratory system to determine whether any of these patients have abnormal laboratory values that may be caused by medications they are taking. Based on the results of the system query, the physician who ordered the medication may receive an alert to log into the EHR to review an automated message.</p>
<p>Answer the following questions:</p>

<li>Why is this scenario an example of clinical decision support?</li>
<li>What is the role of clinical decision support in this situation?</li>
<li>Why is clinical decision support important at the point of care?</li>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 18pt; color: #5e0833;""><strong>Assignment Overview:</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18pt; color: #5e0833;""><strong>Introduction:<br></strong></span><br><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">In the Final Prep [External Trends and Marketing Analysis]&nbsp; assignment you conducted an external analysis of bicycle sales trends and also identified some marketing strategies for this industry.&nbsp; In the Final Prep [ Internal Demographics] assignment you examined Adventure Works customer demographics to try to identify what customer characteristics may lead to the greatest sales or profits.</span></p>
<p>In this final project, you will act as an analyst for the Marketing Manager of Adventure Works Cycles to make use of this interesting/significant information about <strong>current customers</strong>&nbsp;to help inform a marketing campaign in the <strong>Northwest</strong> and <strong>Southwest</strong> regions.</p>
<p>Make sure to read the online article <strong><a title=""MFinals: Read [Market Segmentation]"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/553660/pages/mfinals-read-market-segmentation"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/553660/pages/mfinals-read-market-segmentation"" data-api-returntype=""Page"">MFinals: Read [Market Segmentation]</a></strong> before starting to create your customer segments.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #0000ff;""><em>Customer segmentation</em></span></strong><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>is the process of dividing&nbsp;</span><em>customers</em><span>&nbsp;into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Focus on what you have learned about the Adventure Works customers to identify 2 customer segments based on criteria you discover that differentiates your current customers. You also need to justify your chosen customer segments based on the external industry trends and market analysis.&nbsp; &nbsp;Using Adventure Works dimensions, measures and calculated fields, create charts and dashboards to illustrate your identified customer segments.&nbsp; Also use dashboards to manage charts, text, images, links to sources that present a marketing strategy for each of these customer segements.</p>
<p>You will then make use of a Tableau Story to present your findings to the Marketing Manager and suggest a marketing campaign plan focused on those criteria that seem to differentiate your customers.&nbsp; Should you focus on the best customers or the customers with highest potential to try to bring in more revenue?&nbsp; Make your case in the story<br><br></p>

<h3><strong style=""color: #5e0833; font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'Lato Extended', Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">Instructions:</strong></h3>
<h4><span style=""color: #300b96; font-size: 18pt;""><strong>Getting Started:</strong></span></h4>
<p><strong>Step 1:&nbsp; Open your Final Project workbook you started in the Final Prep: Internal Demographics assignment.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Remember the user login information for the Adventure Works SQL Server data warehouse data source.<em><br></em><br><strong>Server:</strong> <strong>bigdataa.ad.uvu.edu</strong><br><strong>Username:</strong> <strong>INFO4120</strong><br><strong>Password:</strong> <strong>Not2020!</strong></p>
<h4><span style=""color: #000080; font-size: 18pt;""><strong>Identify 2 Customer Segments:</strong></span></h4>
<p><span>As business data analyst for Adventure Works Cycle, you will be responsible for identifying 2 different customer segments and the criteria used to group customers into each of these segments. You must use calculated fields to identify these customer segments, rather than grouping, clustering or other means to determine these customer segments.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One of these customer segments will be a value-based <strong>Gold/Silver/Bronze</strong> customer based on customers who bring in the most Sales Amount and/or Profit.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>The second customer segment you create must m</span><span>ake use of actual customer demographic charts from your previous Final Prep assignment to help identify two or three characteristics that help to define and justify this segmentation. </span><span>You will also need to make use of ideas gathered from your external industry trends and market outlook analysis to support this second customer segment. You will again use a calculated field to identify the customers in this demographic-based customer segment.</span></p>
<p><span>Using techniques you have learned this semester choose appropriate visualization charts, calculated fields, filters, sorting, and formatting to create worksheets and dashboards that identify, explain and justify your two customer segments.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong> Remember this is an individual project.&nbsp; The customer segments, and organization of charts, calculated fields, etc. must be unique to you.</span></p>
<h4><span style=""color: #5e0833; font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Create a Value-Based Customer Segment</strong></span></h4>
<p><strong>Step 2.&nbsp; Creating a value-based Gold/Silver/Bronze customer segment.</strong></p>
<p><span>To get you started, the first customer segment you will create will be a value-based customer segment we will call the <strong>Gold/Silver/Bronze</strong> customer segment. &nbsp;The range you set for Gold customers should be the very best customers, Silver customers are a step down from Gold, and Bronze customers are a step down from Silver.&nbsp; &nbsp;You may choose to not include the lowest value customers in this segment.</span></p>
<p><span>You&nbsp;<strong>must use a single calculated field</strong>&nbsp;to identify the Gold/Silver/Bronze customer segment.&nbsp; Do not create separate calculated fields for Gold, Silver and Bronze, but one Gold/Silver/Bronze calculated field.&nbsp; Name the calculated field Gold/Silver/Bronze.</span></p>
<p><span>The value Measures (Sales Amount and/or Profit) and ranges of values you use to define this customer segment will be up to you to justify based on the which customers contribute to the highest Sales Amount and/or Profit. If you decide to include Profit as your value-based Measure, you will need to use a calculated field to add this to your Measures.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Suggestion:&nbsp;</strong>When deciding on the ranges for your customer segment, you may want to use a text table to order all customers by their Sales Amount or Profit and see where break points occur. &nbsp;Make sure when you are identifying your Gold/Silver/Bronze segment you are filtering to only see customers in the&nbsp;<strong>Northwest&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Southwest</strong>&nbsp;regions.&nbsp; &nbsp;You will also probably want to use the&nbsp;<strong>DimCustomer Customer Key&nbsp;</strong>field to view customers as customer name fields are NULL for some customers.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 3.&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Create a chart visualization to demonstrate your Gold/Silver/Bronze customer segment.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Create a chart visualization to make sure this value-based customer segment calculated field is working correctly. &nbsp;Make sure to filter the chart to only show data from the <strong>Northwest and Southwest regions</strong>.&nbsp; </span><span>Apply sorting, filtering and formatting to your chart to make your visualization readable and understandable.</span></p>
<p><span>Provide a chart title that explains that&nbsp;this is the Gold/Silver/Bronze Customer segment.<br><br><strong>Step 4.&nbsp; Create a Text Table of your top Gold customers.</strong></span></p>
<p>Create a Text Table chart showing contact information on your top Gold customers based on a value criteria that is important to the business. &nbsp;<span>You can show only Gold customers in this table by&nbsp;</span><strong>using a filter</strong><span>&nbsp;of your Gold/Silver/Bronze calculated field.&nbsp; How may Gold customers can you afford to include in this campaign?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In the Text Table, use the <strong>Customer Key</strong> together with the customer name ( some of which will be NULL), and other customer contact information useful for targeted marketing.</p>
<p><span>Make sure to show the value-based Measure (Sales Amount and/or Profit)&nbsp;</span><strong>as a filter<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span>so a user can choose how many of these Gold customers to show in the Text Table.</span></p>
<p>Provide a chart title that clearly explains the purpose of this Text Table.</p>
<h4><span style=""color: #5e0833; font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Create a Demographic-Based Customer Segment</strong></span></h4>
<p><strong>Step 5. &nbsp;Creating a demographic-based customer segment.</strong></p>
<p><span>As analyst, you must also identify one additional customer segment, based upon a combination of demographic characteristics of Adventure Works customers and also <strong>supported by your Internet industry trends and outlook research</strong>. You&nbsp;<strong>must use a calculated field</strong>&nbsp;to create this demographic-based customer segment.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Apply the KISS Principle:</strong><br>Keep your demographic-based customer segment focused and based on <strong>two or three demographic criteria</strong> found in AdventureWorks data and also supported by your external research.&nbsp; Do <strong>NOT</strong> combine too many attributes into this customer segment.&nbsp; If you are trying to show correlations, adding too many attributes increases the permutation.&nbsp; The easier it is to understand your customer segment, the more likely it will be to find and apply a good marketing strategy. An example of a demographic-based customer segment might be&nbsp;<strong>Women &gt; 30 with no children</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>This customer segment could be used to show characteristics of current customers, or to show characteristics that are missing in current customers that could be leveraged by targeted marketing to potential customers. You must use a&nbsp;<strong>calculated field</strong>&nbsp;to define this customer segment.&nbsp; Do not use other techniques like grouping or clustering to create this segment.</span></p>
<p><span> Provide a<em><strong><span style=""color: #5e0833;""> meaningful name</span>&nbsp;</strong></em>for this customer segment&nbsp; and associated calculated field.&nbsp; For example, a customer segment that selects females, with children at home &gt; 0,&nbsp; and according to external research showing that mothers are often concerned about safe bike riding, then you might call your customer segment : <strong><span style=""color: #5e0833;"">Safety Mom</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 6.&nbsp; Create a chart visualization to demonstrate your second customer segment.</strong></p>
<p><span>Show your demographic-based customer segment calculated field is working correctly by creating a chart visualization featuring this customer segment.&nbsp; Make sure to filter the chart to only show data from the&nbsp;</span><strong>Northwest and Southwest regions</strong><span>.&nbsp; Apply sorting, filtering, formatting, and a descriptive chart title to your chart to make your visualization of this demographic-based customer segment readable and understandable.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 7</strong>. <strong>Create a Text Table of your top customers in this second customer segment.</strong></span></p>
<p>In a Text Table, use the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Customer Key</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>together with the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>customer name</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>( some of which will be NULL), and other contact information useful for targeted marketing.</p>
<p>In the chart, also show an additional business value-based Measure criteria<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>as a filter<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>so a user can choose how many customers to show. This value-based criteria might be something like Sales Amount, Profit , or Order Quantity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide a chart title that clearly explains how these customers were chosen</p>
<h4><span style=""font-size: 18pt;""><strong><span style=""color: #02075d;"">----------------------------------------------</span></strong></span></h4>
<h4><span style=""color: #660870; font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Creating Dashboards for Explanation and Justification</strong></span></h4>
<p><strong>Step 8.&nbsp; Use dashboards to explain the two customer segments.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gold/Silver/Bronze Dashboard:</strong><span> In this dashboard you should add charts, text and web URLs&nbsp;to demonstrate your Gold/Silver/Bronze customer segment.&nbsp; You do not need to justify your Gold/Silver/Bronze segment with external research, but you do need explain how you chose which of the value-based criteria and range of values you used to create this segment.</span></p>
<p><strong>Demographic-based customer segment Dashboard (use your meaningful segment name):</strong><span> In this dashboard you should add charts, text, images, and web URLs&nbsp;to demonstrate your demographic-based customer segment.&nbsp; You should be able to explain your segmentation based on two or more demographic criteria in the Adventure Works data and also support your findings with information from your external industry trends and market analysis research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Customer Segment Dashboard Suggestions:</strong><br>Use the following on your dashboards to explain and justify your customer segments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include chart(s) to illustrate your customer segment.</li>
<li>Add text, headings, images to help explain the customer segment.</li>
<li>You may quote pertinent sections of research source in a text area.</li>
<li>You may also add images to help explain or emphasize a point.</li>
<li>But you<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>MUST</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>make sure to include either a link and or web URL section to the evidence on a dashboard so the audience of the analysis can go to the source.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style=""font-size: 14pt; color: #660870;""><strong>Create Dashboards to Present Marketing Strategies</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Step 9.&nbsp; Create a dashboard for each of your customer segments that proposes a marketing strategy.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Marketing Strategy Dashboard Suggestions:</strong><br>Use the following on your dashboards to explain and justify the marketing strategy for each of your two customer segments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include the Text Table chart for the customer segment and show the filter so the user can narrow down the customers.</li>
<li>You may also include other related charts if they will help explain the marketing strategy.</li>
<li>Add text, headings, images to help explain the your marketing strategy. specific to the customer segment.</li>
<li>You may quote pertinent sections of&nbsp; an Internet research source in a text area.</li>
<li>You may also add images to help explain or emphasize a point.</li>
<li>But you<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>MUST</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>make sure to include either a link and or web URL section to the external evidence to support your marketing strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>The research you choose to use as support of your marketing strategy must be unique to your project.</span></p>
<h4><span style=""font-size: 18pt;""><strong><span style=""color: #02075d;"">Prepare a Marketing Campaign Story</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>You will make use of a Tableau Story to present your findings to the Marketing Manager of the <strong>Northwest</strong> and <strong>Southwest</strong> regions and suggest a marketing plan for each of your proposed customer segments.&nbsp; Should you focus on the best current customers or the current customers with highest potential to try to bring in more revenue?&nbsp; Make your case in the story.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>The Story must contain at least 10 story points and no more than 15 story points.</li>
<li>Keep the Story captions brief and concise.&nbsp; Add additional Text areas if you need more explanation in a story point.</li>
<li>First couple of story points should <strong>introduce the purpose of the analysis</strong>.</li>
<li>Last few story points should <strong>make marketing recommendations</strong> specifically geared to each of your 2 customer segments and provide a conclusion.</li>
<li>Do not waste story point with only text.&nbsp; Support the text with charts, or evidence.&nbsp; You have a limited number of story points,"" use them wisely"".</li>
<li>Explain the criteria you used to differentiate the value-based Gold, Silver and Bronze customers.</li>
<li>Explain the criteria you used to differentiate the demographic-based customer segment ( use your meaningful name to refer to this segment).</li>
<li>In the story points use of Worksheets, and Dashboards to explain your analysis , findings, research and marketing recommendations for each of the two customer segments.</li>
<li>Provide filters, legends and controls where appropriate in Worksheets and Dashboards to allow the user to interact with the elements of the story.</li>
<li>Format your Worksheets to use correct data formatting, use filtering, sorting and groups or sets to direct attention.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p><span style=""color: #e03e2d; font-size: 18pt;""><strong>Potential Problems with this Analysis Project<br>(things that have caused student trouble in the past)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #e03e2d; font-size: 14pt;""><strong>This is an Individual Project!!! &nbsp;</strong> </span></p>
<p>While you may problem solve and share ideas with classmates, your charts, dashboards and story analysis in Tableau must be unique to you.&nbsp; If your work is found to not be a unique solution, all students involved will receive a 0 on this assignment.</p>
<p>Some students have received a 0 score on this important project because they ""shared"" their entire project, or individual charts, customer segments, marketing strategies, external research with other students.&nbsp; If your project has a very strong similarity in the charts, dashboards, calculated fields, or marketing strategies to another student, you will receive a 0 on the assignment.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #e03e2d; font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Starting Late, Not Giving Enough Time and Effort:</strong></span></p>
<p>Some students have waited until the last day or two to start the final project.&nbsp; They ran out of time and did not have time to think through or refine their work.</p>
<p>The Final Prep assignments were created to help you start early on this project by doing the marketing analysis and also some work exploring the Adventure Works demographics ahead of time before beginning the final project.</p>
<p>Even with this preliminary work, the final project will take some time (shoot for around 10 hours, but may take longer.).&nbsp; So be sure to not wait too late to get going.</p>
<p>Please ask for help if you are spinning your wheels or don't understand any of the steps or instructions.<br>Refer to the video overview for some guidance.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #e03e2d;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">AdventureWorks DataSource - No Custom Queries or Datasource Filtering:</span></strong></span></p>
<p>Do only the able joins on the AdventureWorks datasource&nbsp; as described in the previous Final Prep assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Do <strong>NOT</strong> do any data source filtering, sorting or custom queries.&nbsp; Your instructor needs to be able to ensure we are all working with the exact same data source when your work is evaluated.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #e03e2d; font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Problems with Dates and Timelines - Don't use these in Customer analysis:</strong></span></p>
<p>Because this Adventure Works data warehouse an older, artificial data warehouse made up by Microsoft, we have modified some of the date values to make them more current.&nbsp; But there are still some problems with some of the dates. In this analysis you are being asked to do, we are interested in customer-related fields and values, not purchase trends, so stay clear of dates and timeline analyses.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #e03e2d; font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Demographic-Based Customer Segment Too Complicated:</strong></span></p>
<p>Apply KISS principles when creating and justifying the demographic-based customer segment.</p>
<p>Make sure the customer segment you defined is easy to understand and combines at most two or three criteria.&nbsp; The ranges of values used for breakpoints or key values should be supported by the data and external research.&nbsp; Explain and justify your decisions.</p>
<p>Some students in the past have just thrown together a laundry list of criteria: yearly income, marital status, number of children, gender, occupation, number of cars all in a single customer segment.&nbsp; You can see first it would be impossible to manage the permutations of the values and ranges found in all these criteria.&nbsp; Most importantly, it is not understandable, supportable with marketing strategies, and highly suspect as to its usefulness.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""color: #e03e2d; font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Customer Segment Must be Supported by the Data:</strong></span></p>
<p>The criteria you choose to use for defining a customer segment must be supported by the Adventure Works data and also external research.</p>
<p>For example, just saying that those with highest income are Gold customers could be a poor or misleading criteria for a customer segment if the data does not show this to be supported in sales or profit, two things the business cares about.</p>
<p>Another example, saying that Number of Children &gt; 3 is criteria of a <span style=""color: #5e0833;""><strong>Prized Parent </strong></span>customer segment just because it sounds good, may not be supported by the data or external research.&nbsp; Maybe those with 0 children bring in more sales or profit.<br><br></p>
<p><span style=""color: #e03e2d; font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Show Evidence for External Sources:</strong></span></p>
<p>You will be asked to find external sources to support your choices in your demographic-based customer segment and marketing strategies.&nbsp; When you refer to these in your story, you must link to or show as web URL section in a dashboard.&nbsp; You may choose to include short quotes from your sources.&nbsp; Remember, you must provide the source of this citation with a link or web URL section.</p>
<p>You may also use images to illustrate your segmentation and marketing decisions.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt; color: #e03e2d;""><strong>Make Grading Easier (instructor is happy):</strong></span></p>
<p>Please do <strong>NOT </strong>hide worksheets or dashboards in Tableau.<br>Use chart titles, text areas on dashboards, and very short captions in the story to explain and justify your decisions.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt; color: #e03e2d;""><strong>Submit Correct File Type (instructor is happy):</strong></span></p>
<p>Make sure you submit a zip file of the entire project folder containing the Tableau workbook with the .twb extension and all graphics inserted into the story.<br>Do<strong> NOT</strong> submit a PDF file.<br>Do <strong>NOT </strong>submit just the Tableau workbook.<br>Do <strong>NOT</strong> submit a Tableau packaged workbook .twbx extension.</p>

<h3><span style=""color: #5e0833;""><strong>Part A:&nbsp; Find Biking Industry Trends&nbsp;</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>Conduct some Internet research on the demographics of customers who are buying bicycles and trends of who are riding bicycles. Focus on recent bicycle sales or riding trends in the United States, and the&nbsp;</span><strong>Northwest</strong><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong>Southwest</strong><span>&nbsp;regions specifically.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adventure Works demographics for existing customers include: <strong>age, gender, marital status, income level, education level, location, commute distance, number of children, and number of children at home</strong>.&nbsp; Focus your Internet research on these demographics related to <span>who is buying bicycles and their riding trends in the&nbsp;</span><strong>Northwest</strong><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong>Southwest</strong><span>&nbsp;regions of the United States.</span></p>
<p>The goal is to find<strong> 4-5 online sources</strong> that show interesting trends and outlook in the online Bicycle industry related to the <strong>Adventure Works DimCustomer table customer demographics</strong><span>.&nbsp; Show some breadth in your selections.&nbsp; For example, don't have all your sources focus on Age.</span> &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Some example search questions ( find your own trend questions) :</strong></span><br><span>What are the age ranges of the best bicycle customers?<br></span><span>Has Covid 19 affected who is riding bikes?&nbsp;</span><br><span>Are more families with young children riding bikes?</span><br><span>How to men differ in their bike buying habits from women?&nbsp;</span><br><span>Do women focus more on bike safety?</span><br><span>Are bike commuters more likely to have lower income?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span>Are people with college education more likely to wear helmets?</span><br><span>Do people buy more than one bike?<br>What age group are the largest bike riders in the Pacific Northwest?</span></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong><span>: Adventure Works is a fictional business whose products do not include e-bikes or what are called “gravel” bikes.&nbsp; While these are big trends in biking industry, with our existing data warehouse, these categories of bikes are not available, so please do not focus your Internet Search on types of bikes trending, rather focus on who is buying and riding bikes and what are their characteristics.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Summarize Your Industry Trends Findings:</strong></h4>
<p>In a Word file, provide a title and a link along with a paragraph or two summary and some short quotes or statistics for each article you have found.</p>

<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong><span>&nbsp;In class this semester we have explored using digital marketing analysis tools like Google Analytics, but because this is not a real business with an e-commerce website or mobile app presence that we can interact with, please focus on finding articles that suggest more traditional marketing strategies like personalization, customer relationship marketing, referrals, social media, etc.</span></p>
<p><strong>Some example search questions ( find your own marketing strategy questions) :</strong><br><span>Would expert blogs be a way to attract customers to your online business?</span><br><span>How can customer demographics be used for targeted marketing of existing bicycle customers?</span><br><span>Can use of referrals work for an online bicycle shop?</span></p>
<h4><strong>Summarize Your Marketing Strategies:</strong></h4>

<p>This next Video Explains how to push all your changes on your site to Github to show up on your site,</p>
<p>I recommend that you have ported all your JS Fiddles to your code before attempting to push, so you only have to&nbsp;</p>
<p>push your changes once.</p>

<p><strong>Helpful Hint If your graphs don't show up correctly:</strong></p>
<p>to make sure all your charts work, you will need to make sure you have all the right script source js files, otherwise your graphs may not show up correctly ( or show up at all!) replace your script files with the lines below, also they make not work if not in the right order.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 18pt;""><strong><span style=""color: #5e0833;"">Assignment Overview:</span></strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>""Know your Customer!""&nbsp;</strong> The purpose of this assignment is to help you get started on your Final Project analysis by asking you to explore the Adventure Works data warehouse customer demographic data so you can learn about the current Adventure Works customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this assignment, you will specifically examine Adventure Works customer demographic fields to determine what <strong>customer characteristics</strong> (demographics) contribute to the most Sales Amount or Profit (would need to be a calculated field if used). <span>These two measures could be referred to as ""value"" metrics.</span></p>
<p>You will use this internal customer demographic information from this Final Prep assignment along with the external Industry Trends and Marketing Analysis you conducted in your first Final Prep assignment to help inform your Final Project analysis and reporting.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #5e0833;""><strong>Assignment Objectives:</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>Upon completion of this class assignment you will be able to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Start the Final Project Tableau workbook with the correctly structured Adventure Works data source</li>
<li>Examine the DimCustomer table, customer-specific dimensions and customer-specific measures to better understand what demographics show better Sales and/or Profit</li>
<li>Change customer measures that should not be aggregated to be dimensions</li>
<li>Filter all visualizations according to the required Sales Territory Regions: <strong>Northwest</strong> and <strong>Southwest </strong>regions.</li>
<li>Create visualizations to demonstrate key <strong>customer demographics</strong> with relation to SalesAmount and/or Profit</li>
</ul>

<h3><span style=""color: #000080; font-size: 18pt;""><strong>Part A: Setting Up your Final Project Tableau Workbook</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>Step 1.&nbsp; Open your Tableau 2 Workbook.</strong></p>
<p>You may start with your <strong>Tableau2</strong> <strong>Assignment </strong>workbook for the SQL Server data source and table joins you already have done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be asked to login to the data source when you open the workbook. Note: The SQL Server login information has changed since the video overview was done.&nbsp; Please use the login informtion found below.</p>
<p><strong>Server: bigdataa.ad.uvu.edu<br>Database:<span>&nbsp;AdventureWorksDW2019<br></span></strong>Select the radiobutton: Use a specific username and password<br><strong>Username: INFO4120</strong><br><strong>Password: Not2020!</strong><br><strong></strong></p>
<p>In the Data Source, your Adventure Works table joins should be as shown in Fig. 1 below:</p>
<p><strong><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/553660/files/113404886/preview?verifier=Ybmy9npuv39H5o3uIVUUBbmGWgQJSroS9n1SqCAL"" alt=""Adventure Works Tables"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/553660/files/113404886"" data-api-returntype=""File"">&nbsp;</strong>Fig. 1.&nbsp; AdventureWorks DW table structure</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.&nbsp; Do a Save As to rename your Tableau 2 Workbook.</strong></p>
<p>Once you are in the workbook, you should do a <strong>Save As </strong>on your Tableau 2 workbook and save it with your initials as in: <strong>KBFinalProject.twb</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.&nbsp; Close data sources that are not needed.</strong></p>
<p>Go to your first sheet in the workbook, in the <strong>Data</strong> pane in the upper left corner, you will see listed the data sources that were used in the Tableau 2 assignment.&nbsp; We want to keep the only the FactInternetSales(AdventureWorksDW2019) data source.&nbsp; Right-click and choose <strong>Close</strong> for each of the other data sources.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.&nbsp; Delete sheets used in Tableau 2 assignment.</strong></p>
<p>You can then delete the sheets from the Tableau 2 assignment.&nbsp; Then you are ready to start your Final Prep assignment with the Adventure Works data source loaded and working.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #02075d; font-size: 18pt;""><strong>Part B: Examine Adventure Works Measures and Dimensions</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; color: #000080;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The main focus of your Final Project will be to act as an analyst of Adventure Works Cycles working for the Marketing Manager of the <strong>Southwest Region</strong> and the <strong>Northwest Region</strong>.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>In this Final Prep assignment, you have been asked to find out which of the Adventure Works&nbsp;</span><strong>customer demographics,<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span>found in the DimCustomer table, contribute to the most Sales and or Profits (Profit this measure would need to be calculated).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong>Do not</strong><span>&nbsp;spend time analyzing products or different regions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt; color: #000080;""><strong>Examine Adventure Works Measures and Dimensions:</strong></span></p>
<p>To get an initial understanding of the Dimensions and Measures related to customer demographics.&nbsp; These Dimensions and Measures are located in the DimCustomer table.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.&nbsp; Change DimCustomer Measures to be Dimensions.</strong></p>
<p>The Measures found in the DimCustomer table are numeric fields that should not have aggregated functions applied to them. For example, the <strong>Yearly Income</strong> should not have SUM(Yearly Income) applied to it because this would sum the Yearly Income for all the customer's orders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way to prevent inappropriate aggregation applied to numeric fields is to change these Measures to Dimensions.</p>
<p>Change each numeric Measures found in the <strong>DimCustomer</strong> table to a Dimension, by right-clicking on the Measure and choosing <strong>Convert to Dimension</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.&nbsp; Explore Customer Dimensions with chart visualizations.</strong></p>
<p>Examine the DimCustomer Dimension fields. Many of these fields could be considered customer ""demographics"".&nbsp; Some examples would be English Occupation, English Education, and Gender.&nbsp; These fields will allow us to explore the internal customer demographics to find characteristics of our best Adventure Works customers.</p>
<p>In your workbook, use worksheets to create chart visualizations to help find which of the many Customer Dimensions/demographics show clear differences between the best customers, and not so good customers based on SalesAmount or Profit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important: </strong>Also make sure the data you are looking at in your charts is filtered by the correct SalesTerritory Regions: <strong>Northwest and Southwest Regions </strong>only.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may create calculated fields to extend the available Measures and Dimensions.&nbsp; For example, there is no Age Dimension in the data set, but there is a BirthDate field.&nbsp; It would be easier for the audience to compare customer Ages on a chart or table than have to make the conversion of a BirthDate in their head.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.&nbsp; Choose the 5 - 6 charts that clearly show ""best"" customers.</strong></p>
<p><span>Narrow down your worksheets to the&nbsp;</span><strong>&nbsp;5 - 6 charts</strong><span>&nbsp;that show you understand which of the Customer Dimensions/demographics show clear differences in customer characteristics based on the ""value"" metrics of SalesAmount or Profit.</span></p>
<p>Delete worksheets where the chart does not help differentiate between the most valuable customers and those who are not so valuable.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong> If you created a chart of SalesAmount by Number of Children at Home and there are not any clear differences in SUM(SalesAmount) for the different Number of Children at Home, that Dimension/demographic should probably not be one you hang your hat on. You should delete that worksheet from your workbook.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.&nbsp; Fine tune charts to make them readable and understandable.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you choose an appropriate chart type, add labels, add formatting of axes values and labels, set appropriate titles and sheet labels to support your analysis of what characteristics help identify who are the <strong>most valuable</strong> Adventure Works customers based on SalesAmount or Profit.</p>

<p><span>The FactInternetSales.OrderDate and FactInternetSales.OrderDate field values are not current dates.&nbsp;We are interested in DimCustomer, customer-related fields and values, not purchase trends over time, so stay clear of dates and timeline analyses. Instead focus analysis of&nbsp;</span><strong>customer characteristics</strong><span>&nbsp;that&nbsp;</span><strong>do not<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span>involve dates or trends over time.&nbsp; The only date that is probably safe to use is BirthDate.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt; color: #ff0000;""><strong>Submit Correct File Type (instructor is happy):</strong></span></p>

<h4><span style=""color: #333399;""><strong>Creating an Account in GTM</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Step 1.&nbsp; Create an account in Google Tag Manager.</strong></span></p>
<p>Go to your Google Analytics and Sign In to your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In the upper right corner by the ? Help Menu, click on the 4 squares icon to <strong>Switch products</strong>.&nbsp; Choose <strong>Google Tag Manager</strong>.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong><br>Step 2:&nbsp; Add an account in GTM.</strong></span></p>
<p>Click the blue link <strong>Create Account</strong>.&nbsp; Set the Account name: <strong>MarioKartSiteGTM</strong>.&nbsp; <br>Click Continue.<br>The Container name will also be: <strong>MarioKartSiteGTM</strong>.&nbsp; Choose <strong>Web</strong>. <br>Click Save.</p>
<p>You can create different containers in the same account, but we will just use the one container.</p>
<h4><span style=""color: #333399;""><strong>Setup a New MarioKartGTM Website</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #e03e2d;""><em><strong><span>Note: </span></strong>your mariokart site will stay the same, but we will be changing the google tags in it.</em></span></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #e03e2d;""><em><strong><span>From now on your MarioKart website will be referred to as MarioKart GTM</span></strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Step 1.&nbsp; Finding the GTM Tracking Code snippets.</strong></span></p>
<p>In the GTM Overview Page, in the menu click on the <strong>blue link with your GTM-XXXXXXX</strong> Tracking Code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice there are two Tracking Code snippets we will need to copy to our website pages for GTM.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Step 2.&nbsp; Copy the two GTM Tracking code snippets to Every .HTML Page<span style=""color: #e03e2d;""> (Replacing the Old Google Tracking Codes)</span></strong></span></p>
<p>Next open your mariokart_site/index.html file in Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>Go back to GTM and copy the first Tracking code snippet again.<br>Just <strong>below the &lt;head&gt;</strong> tag copy the GTM code snippet. <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong><span style=""color: #e03e2d;"">(Replacing the Old Google Tracking Codes)</span></strong></span></p>
<p>Go back to GTM and copy the second Tracking code snippet.</p>
<p>Just <strong>below the &lt;body&gt;</strong> tag copy the second GTM code snippet. <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong><span style=""color: #e03e2d;"">(Before the Container Tag)</span></strong></span></p>
<p>Save the index.html page and <strong><span style=""color: #e03e2d;"">repeat for each webpage that you have.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Step 3.&nbsp; Commit and Push Your Changes to Your Github Site</strong></span></p>
<h4><span style=""color: #333399;""><strong>Adding Variables in GTM</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Step 1.&nbsp; Create an new Google Analytics MarioKartSiteGTM. account.</strong></span></p>
<p>If you still do not have a Google Analytics tab, Click on your website project name on the top of the screen and right click on the google analytics logo&nbsp;to open an new tab to <strong>Google Analytics</strong>.<br><br>Go to the Admin menu. Create a new Account.<br>Set the Account name to be:&nbsp;<strong>MarioKartSiteGTM.<br><br></strong>Website URL:<br>In your browser, go to your mariokart home page.</p>
<p>Set the website URL to be the home page of your new <strong>MarioKartSiteGTM</strong>.<br>Remember in the http/https&nbsp; dropdown, to change to<strong> https://</strong>&nbsp; Also remove the<strong> / </strong>from the end of the URL.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #843fa1;"">for example: my website is <a style=""color: #843fa1;"" href=""https://tylerbarty.github.io/TylersWebsite/"" target=""_blank"">https://tylerbarty.github.io/TylersWebsite/ &nbsp;</a></span><span style=""color: #843fa1;"">so I would fill out the field as tylerbarty.github.io/TylersWebsite</span></p>
<p>In your new Account, under Property Tracking ID, copy just the Google Analytics <strong>Tracking ID</strong>.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Step 2.&nbsp; In GTM, Set a GA Settings to connect GA4</strong></span></p>

<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Step 3.&nbsp; Configure needed Built-In Variables in GTM.</strong></span></p>
<p>GTM has a set of Built-In variables we can use as we create tags and triggers.</p>
<p>We will turn on ALL the Build-In Variables so they will be visible if we need them.</p>
<p>Click Variables from the GTM left menu.&nbsp; Click the Configure button.<br>Check <strong>all</strong> the boxes to Configure the Build-In Variables.<br><br></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Step 4.&nbsp; Add a Click Listener Tag in GTM.</strong></span></p>
<p>When users do a Pageview on your website, this Click Listener will send a Hit event back to Google Analytics.&nbsp; We will have a PageURL and other information that we can use to track these Pageviews.</p>
<p>In GTM, click the <strong>Tag</strong> option in the left menu.&nbsp; Click the <strong>New</strong> button.<br>Name the tag: <strong>Click Listener Tag</strong>.&nbsp; <br>Click the Tag Configuration.&nbsp; <strong>Choose Google Analytics:GA4 Event</strong></p>
<p><strong>Click Triggering (below)<br>Check </strong>All Pages<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Click<strong><span style=""color: #000000;""> Save.</span></strong></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Step 2.&nbsp; View GTM Page Views in Google Analytics.</strong></span></p>
<p>Because we have tied our GTM Tag to the Google Analytics Tracking code of our new Account, when we do Pageview events on the website, these are tracked also in our Google Analytics account.</p>
<p>Visit several pages on your MarioKart website. you also visit on your phone to give more traffic to your site (you could even have a friend or family member visit it on their computer/phone)</p>
<p>Go to your MarioKartGTM Google Analytics account.&nbsp; In the Reports -&gt; Realtime, click to see the last 30 minutes. be patient, it could take awhile for traffic to start showing up.&nbsp; You should see all the pages you viewed.</p>

<h4><span style=""color: #333399;""><strong>Tracking Youtube Video Events with GTM</strong></span></h4>
<p>This example of setting up Youtube Video tracking will make use of triggers, variables and tags.&nbsp; When a user comes to your landing page and clicks on your video, the trigger tells Google Tag Manager that someone has carried out an action worth tracking.&nbsp; We will create two different triggers and a tag.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Step 1. Creating Youtube Video Start Trigger.</strong></span></p>
<p>In GTM, click click the <strong>Trigger</strong> from the left menu. Click the New Button</p>
<p>Name the trigger: <strong>Trigger-Video Start</strong>.<br>Click <strong>Trigger Configuration</strong>.&nbsp; Select <strong>User Engagement-&gt;YouTube Video</strong>.</p>
<p>We will only capture the Start event in this trigger.<br>Click the Start option.<br>Click to Add JavaScript API support to YouTube videos<br>Click Some Videos.</p>
<p>Fire this trigger when an Event...</p>
<p>Choose <strong>Page URL&nbsp;</strong> <strong>contains</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Media.html<br></strong>Save the trigger.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Step 2.&nbsp; Creating the Youtube Video Progress Trigger.</strong></span></p>
<p>Add another New Trigger</p>
<p>name the trigger:&nbsp;<strong>Youtube Progress Trigger</strong></p>
<p>Click the Trigger Configuration. Choose User Engagement-&gt;Youtube Video.</p>
<p>Check Complete and Progress.</p>
<p>Set the Percentages to be: 25, 50, 75, 100</p>
<p>Check Add JavaScript API support to all Youtube videos</p>
<p>Choose Some Videos</p>
<p><strong>Save your trigger</strong></p>
<p>Next we will set variables to allow this event tracking.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Step 3.&nbsp; Create the Youtube Video Tag.</strong></span></p>
<p>We are assuming all the Build-In variables are already checked from the previous GTM assignment.</p>
<p>Click Tags in the left GTM menu.&nbsp; Click the New button.</p>
<p>Name the tag: <strong>GA-Video Tracking Tag</strong>.</p>
<p>Click in the Tag Configuration.</p>
<p>Choose&nbsp; the tag type to be <strong>Google Analytics: GA4 Event</strong></p>
<p>Select your previous Google analytics configuration tag</p>
<p>set Event name as &nbsp;<strong>{{Page Hostname}} </strong>(include the double brackets on each side)</p>
<p>in the triggering section add&nbsp;<strong>Trigger-Video Start&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>Youtube Progress Trigger&nbsp;</strong>(note that these are the triggers that you just created)</p>
<p>click save.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Step 4.&nbsp; Test your Youtube Video Tag and Triggers.</strong></span></p>
<p>In GTM we will use the Preview and Debugging features of GTM to make sure our tag and triggers are working.&nbsp; Click the <strong>Preview button</strong> at the top of your GTM Workspace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the Chrome Browser, view your MarioKartGTM website from the Internet.&nbsp; You should now see the bottom half of the web page has the Tag Assistant Connected.</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Media.html</strong> page.</p>
<p>Click on the Play button for the Youtube Video.&nbsp; In the Tag Assistant Tab, you should now see that the Video Tracking Tag has fired.&nbsp; Drag the video play until just before it finishes.&nbsp; Allow the video to finish.</p>
<p>note that you have another user engagement in the tag assistant.</p>
<p><strong>Take a screenshot of your tag assistant and paste it in a word file</strong></p>
<p>in your Tag manager, submit your changes this far</p>
<p>Close Tag assistant and visit your website and play the video an incognito tab</p>
<p>Go to your MarioKartGTM Google Analytics account.&nbsp; In Reports&gt; Realtime there is an Events card you should see three Video events: start, progress and complete. to get more stats up, consider pulling out your smartphone or having a friend or a roommate or a family member visit your website</p>
<p><strong>Take a screenshot of the events card in Reports&gt;Realtime.&nbsp; Paste the screenshot in a Word file.</strong></p>
<h4><span style=""color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Tracking Form Submission Events</strong></span></h4>
<p>For some businesses, form submission events are an important conversion event.&nbsp; We will use GTM to help track when the user completes a form on our MarioKartGTM.</p>

<p><strong>Looker Studio 1:&nbsp; Intro, Adding design elements, Scorecards, and Pie Chart (Video)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong> Create a Looker Studio Account.</strong><br>Go to <strong><a href=""https://datastudio.google.com"">https://datastudio.google.com</a></strong> and login into Looker Studio using your Google Analytics login.&nbsp; <br>You may be asked to accept conditions of use.</p>
<p>Once you have a Looker Studio account, you can go to Google Analytics, and in the 4 squares next to your profile image, choose Looker Studio.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Creating a Looker Studio Dashboard Report.</strong></p>
<p>The home section has some templates and sample reports.&nbsp; But we will click on the <strong>Blank</strong> report to start a new blank report.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Add data to report.</strong></p>
<p>A screen will appear that allows you to add data to your report.</p>
<p>Click on the <strong>My data sources</strong> tab.</p>
<p>We will use the<strong> [Sample] Google Analytics</strong> as the Data Source.&nbsp; This is data from the Google Merchandise Store.&nbsp; <br>Click the <strong>Add button </strong>and then<strong> Add to Report </strong>to add the dataset to your report.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Title the report and set the layout.</strong></p>
<p>By default, the report title is Untitled Report.&nbsp; Change the title to include your own full name as in: <strong>Tyler Bartholomew Audience Overview</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on the default table chart&nbsp; that was placed on the report and delete it.</p>
<p>Click on Theme and Layout in the tool bar. You can find several different themes.&nbsp; We will leave the Current Theme to be the <strong>Default</strong></p>
<p>Click the Layout Tab in the Theme and Layout Panel, and set the Canvas size to be: <strong>US letter (4:3) Portrait</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.&nbsp; Add design elements to the report.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a class=""instructure_file_link"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/553660/files/113404766/download?verifier=ZFdWRlyfgycxPeKip6BIe6wA77zkqvbUYgxETbCv&amp;wrap=1"" target=""_blank"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/553660/files/113404766"" data-api-returntype=""File"">Logo Images (zipped file)</a></strong></p>
<p>We will add some design elements that will create a header area to the top of the report including a shape, text, and images.</p>
<p>Select the <strong><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/553660/files/113404763/preview?verifier=JZ1ydJWGAp7GdqBcKsADfATkad5wLVRWEMLfHEPl"" alt=""Annotation 2022-09-29 210153.png"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/553660/files/113404763"" data-api-returntype=""File"">(shape </strong>icon) from the toolbar, and choose a rectangle. Click and drag a rectangle across the top width of the report to create a rectangular header area.&nbsp; In the rectangle properties on the right, choose the background color you would like for the rectangle.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Click the text<strong>&nbsp;</strong>icon in the toolbar and drag a rectangular area in the left side of your header rectangle&nbsp; Set the text to be your own first name and Audience Overview as in: <strong>Kim's Audience Overview</strong>.&nbsp; You can format the text color and size in the Text properties panel on the right. Choose a text color that shows up well.&nbsp; Increase the font size of the text. Position the text to center it vertically in the header.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the <strong>Logo Images</strong> zipped file from above to your desktop.&nbsp; Unzip the file to get the two logo images that will be added to the dashboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Image</strong> icon in the toolbar and browse to find the Google logo image.&nbsp; Drag a rectangle in the middle of the header area for the image.&nbsp; You can resize the image to fit in the header area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add a second <strong>Image</strong> below the header in the upper left of report.&nbsp; Browse to find the Google Merchandise logo image.&nbsp; Again, you can position and resize this image.</p>
<p>To finish the header area, we will add from the <strong>Add a control</strong> drop down in the toolbar, choose a <strong>Date Range</strong> control.&nbsp; Click in the right side of the header to add the Date Range control there.&nbsp; In the right, in the Data panel, choose <strong>last 28 days</strong> from the drop down of the Default date range and Auto date range, and then <strong>Apply</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6. &nbsp;Add Scorecards to the report.</strong></p>
<p>A Scorecard is a chart that displays the numeric value for a single metric.&nbsp; Click the <strong>Add a chart </strong>drop down list and choose <strong>Scorecard.</strong> Place the Scorecard in the the upper left of the canvas.&nbsp; On the right, in the Data panel, you can see the metric of Sessions is the default metric. Change the metric to be <strong>Users</strong>. Using the search box can speed up finding a metric.&nbsp; You may have to scroll down to see Users. The metric displayed on the Scorecard should now to show the Users metric.</p>
<p>In the Data Panel, we also want to have the Scorecard show a date comparison. Click where the Data Comparison shows None and choose <strong>previous year as the Data Comparison. </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on Style Panel to show detail, uncheck the <strong>Hide Comparison Label</strong> to show the date comparison detail.&nbsp; The Users Scorecard should now show the previous year's value as a negative or positive value.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7.&nbsp; Add&nbsp; four more Scorecards.</strong><br><br>Copy and paste t the Users Scorecard four more times.&nbsp; Line up the four new Scorecards below the Users Score card to form a square.<br><br>Change the metric of the four new Scorecards to show these metrics: PageViews, Bounce Rate, Pages/Sessions and Avg. Session Duration. Use the search box to help find these metrics.&nbsp; Align the four Scorecards as a 4 square below the Users Scorecard.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8.&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Add a new Pie chart.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>In the Add a chart drop down list, choose a <strong>Pie Chart</strong>.&nbsp; In the right Data panel, change the dimension to be <strong>Default Channel Groupings</strong>.<br><br>Click on Style and reduce number of slices of the pie to only show 6 slices.&nbsp; Drag the slider to make the pie chart a donut chart.&nbsp; Position the pie chart to the top right side of the canvas.</p>
<p>Use the Text icon in the toolbar, to add a text area above the Pie Chart.&nbsp; Set the text to be: <strong>Top 5 Default Channed Groupings</strong>. Position this text area above the Pie Chart.</p>
<p><iframe style=""width: 400px; height: 244px; display: inline-block;"" title=""Video player for DataStudioPart2.mp4"" data-media-type=""video"" src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/media_objects_iframe/m-3LePd1exkwhyMb6jUXJMCBu7GwuT1EMo?type=video"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"" allow=""fullscreen"" data-media-id=""m-3LePd1exkwhyMb6jUXJMCBu7GwuT1EMo""></iframe>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Looker Studio 1: Adding a Bar Chart, Time Series, Table, and Sharing the Dashboard (VIdeo)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 9.&nbsp; Add a new Bar Chart.</strong></p>
<p>In the Add a chart drop down list, choose a bar with horizontal bars.&nbsp; Add the bar chart on the right below the Pie chart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the right Data panel, change the dimension to be <strong>Device Category</strong>.&nbsp; Make sure the metric used for the Bar Chart is <strong>Sessions</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Style panel, under the Legend section, click to have None.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copy the Pie Chart text area and move it above the Bar Chart.&nbsp; Change the text to be: <strong>Sessions by Device Category</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10.</strong>&nbsp;<strong> Add a Time Series Chart.&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the Add a control drop down list to add a Time Series Chart.&nbsp; Position the Time Series to be to the right of the Bar Chart in the canvas.</p>
<p>In the right Data panel, change the metric for the Time Series to be<strong> Users</strong>.&nbsp; Add Comparison date range of the <strong>Previous Year</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 11</strong>.&nbsp;<strong> Add a Table chart.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>In the Add a chart drop down list, choose a <strong>Table Chart</strong>.&nbsp; Drag the rectangular area for the Table to be across the width near the bottom of the canvas.</p>
<p>In the right Data panel, change the dimension to be<strong> Page</strong>.</p>
<p>Set the metric to be <strong>Pageviews</strong>, Add an additional metric to be <strong>Bounce Rate</strong>.</p>
<p>In Style panel, for the Pageviews which is in <strong>Column 1</strong>, you can click on <strong>Bar</strong>.&nbsp; and check to <strong>Show number</strong>.</p>
<p>For the Bounce Rate which is <strong>Column 2</strong>, change to <strong>Heat map</strong>.&nbsp; Change the color of the Heat map to be a <strong>red</strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Note:</strong> Setting the Heat map to use shades of red implies to viewers that high Bounce Rates are bad.&nbsp; If your metric is something like Revenue, you might want a Heat map to be shades of green, for good.</p>
<p>The Table chart should now show the Pageviews as bars with numbers and the Bounce Rate as Heat map.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 12.&nbsp; Adding a Drop-down List and Advanced Filter controls.</strong></p>
<p>Next, you will add a Drop-down list control that will allow viewers to choose an Age for the dashboard.&nbsp; By default, the data for all ages are shown in the report.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the toolbar, using the <strong>Add a control </strong>drop down list, choose the Drop-down list.&nbsp; Position this Drop Down List above the Time Series Chart. In the Data panel on the right, set the Control field for this control to be <strong>Age</strong>.&nbsp; This control will allow the viewer to filter the dashboard data by the Age.</p>
<p>You will also add an Advanced Filter control to allow viewers to filter the report to show only data from a specified Country.&nbsp; In the toolbar, using the <strong>Add a control</strong> drop down list, choose<strong> Advanced Filter.</strong>&nbsp; Position the Advanced Filter above the Pie Chart.&nbsp; You may have to move the chart and text area down.&nbsp; In the Data panel on the right, set the Control field of the Advanced Filter to be <strong>Country</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>When the report is viewed, the user can then filter the report by a specific Country.&nbsp; The Search options can also be selected by the user.&nbsp; The default search option will be <strong>Equals</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 13&nbsp; Viewing the Dashboard report.</strong></p>
<p>The dashboard report can be viewed by clicking the View button in the upper right corner.<br>Try out the interactive elements of the dashboard:&nbsp; the Age drop-down list, the Country advanced filter, and the Data Range control.</p>
<p>Switch back to edit mode by clicking the Edit blue button.</p>
<p>Once in edit mode again, dashboard components can be repositioned until you are happy with the final look of the report.</p>
<p><strong>Step 14.&nbsp; Sharing a dashboard report.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>There are several ways to share a dashboard report with stakeholders or team members.</p>
<p>For a team member who has permissions to the report, you can choose from the Share drop-down list in the upper right and choose a Get report link.&nbsp; Once a team member has a link, they can view a report.</p>
<p>You can also email a PDF of the report by choosing Schedule email delivery.&nbsp; This share option allows you to schedule how often you want to schedule the frequency of an email report to the recipient.</p>
<p>To share this report with your instructor, you will choose the Invite people.&nbsp; This option will allow your dashboard report to appear in the person's Looker Studio account.&nbsp; You can determine whether they have permission to View or edit the report (just like a google doc).&nbsp; Choose to <strong>Invite People</strong>, and use your instructor's gmail:&nbsp; <strong><a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""mailto:tyler.barty@gmail.com"" target=""_blank"">tyler.barty@gmail.com</a>.</strong>&nbsp; Allow your instructor to Edit the report.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #5e0833;""><strong>Submission:</strong></span><strong></strong></h3>
<p>Make sure you have set your Dashboard report title to include your full name.</p>
<p>Make sure your have also shared your Audience View dashboard with your instructor's gmail account: <strong>tyler.barty@gmail.com</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:&nbsp; Examining the Menu and Toolbar</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Tableau menu </strong>options allows you to add, modify and manage different aspects of your Tableau worksheet.&nbsp; &nbsp;The menu options are contextual, in that some options may be grayed out if they are not available in your current context.&nbsp; For example: On this current worksheet, the only Story option available is New Story because a worksheet is not a story.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tableau toolbar </strong>has options for some of the most frequently used actions.&nbsp; Some of options you will use often are the Undo, Redo, Save,&nbsp; Swap rows and columns .Sort ascending, Sort descending and Show Me.</p>
<p>The <strong>Show Me tool</strong> provides a list of chart types based upon the current Dimensions and Measures on the Rows and Columns shelves.&nbsp; This is a short hand tool that will save you a lot of time as we learn more about creating visualizations in Tableau.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.&nbsp; Data Pane and Analytics Pane</strong></p>
<p>The Data Pane on the left shows the Dimensions and Measures in your active data source.</p>
<p><strong>Dimensions </strong>are fields that are categories or other fields that cannot be aggregated like: Product Name, Categories, and Region.</p>
<p><strong>Measures</strong> are quanitative fields that have numeric values like: Sales, Profit, and Quantity.&nbsp; Measures can be used for mathematical operations or calculations.</p>
<p>When a data source is brought into Tableau, the fields are grouped into Dimensions and Measures.&nbsp; If Tableau makes a determination that is not correct about this classification, you can convert a field from a Measure or Dimension to the other type.</p>
<p>The Analytics Pane can be used to apply advanced analysis features to a chart such as: trend lines, reference lines, forecasts and clustering.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.&nbsp; Shelves and Cards</strong></p>
<p><span class=""instructure_file_link_holder link_holder""><span class=""instructure_scribd_file_holder link_holder""><strong>Shelves:&nbsp;</strong> A shelf are areas in Tableau where you can drop fields so that the data is used to build a visualization.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class=""instructure_file_link_holder link_holder""><span class=""instructure_scribd_file_holder link_holder"">The Rows Shelf creates Rows of a table.&nbsp; </span></span></li>
<li><span class=""instructure_file_link_holder link_holder""><span class=""instructure_scribd_file_holder link_holder"">The Columns shelf creates columns of a table.&nbsp; </span></span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #34495e;"">The Pages shelf allows you to break a view or chart into a series of pages.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #000000;"">The Filters shelf allows you to select criteria to limit or narrow down the data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>

<p><strong>Step 6.&nbsp; Creating a Bar Chart.</strong></p>
<p><span class=""instructure_file_link_holder link_holder""><span class=""instructure_scribd_file_holder link_holder"">There are several ways to select the Dimensions and Measures you would like for a visualization. You can drag fields to shelves or cards to build the structure of your visualization.&nbsp; You can also double-click on a Dimension or Measure and Tableau will apply it to the Row or Columns shelf.</span></span></p>
<p>We will use the double-click method in creating a bar chart.</p>
<p><span class=""instructure_file_link_holder link_holder""><span class=""instructure_scribd_file_holder link_holder""><strong>Double-click the Sales Measure </strong>- Adds Sales to the Rows shelf (You could also drag the Sales to the Rows shelf)<br><strong>Double-click the Category Dimension </strong>- Adds Category to the Columns Shelf<br><strong>Double-click the Sub-Category Dimension</strong> - Adds Sub-Category to the Columns Shelf</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Step 9. Saving your Workbook.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Save your file as a Tableau Workbook</strong> with your intitals to the desktop as in: <strong>KBTableau1.twb</strong></p>
<p>This will save your workbook by default in the My Tableau Repository/Workbooks folder.&nbsp; A Tableau Workbook file only has the visualization information in the file, not the data source.</p>
<p>If you want to package the data source with a workbook you would choose to save the workbook as Packaged Workbook.&nbsp; The advantage of this file format is that someone who does not have access to the data source has it as part of the workbook.&nbsp; The disadvantage is that a Packaged Workbook file could be very large.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10.&nbsp; Submitting your Workbook.</strong></p>
<p>In the File menu, <strong>Print to PDF</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the Range of <strong>Whole workbook.<br></strong>Select Paper Size as <strong>Unspecified</strong>.&nbsp; This will help in putting one chart on one page in the PDF file.</p>
<p>Also choose <strong>Landscape </strong>mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Name your PDF file with your initials: <strong>KBTableau1.pdf</strong><br>Save the PDF.&nbsp; By default it will be saved in your Documents folder.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; Pay close attention to assignment instructions as to how your assignment should saved, exported and submitted.</p>

<p><strong>Tableau 5: Table Lens Intro and Creating a Table Lens (Video Overview)</strong></p>
<h3><span style=""color: #02075d;""><strong>Part A: Healthcare Variables Table Lens</strong></span></h3>
<p>In this exercise we will build a table lens to help compare life expectancy at birth, neonatal mortality rate, under-five mortality rate, and per capita health spending by Country.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Open Tableau and create a new worksheet.</strong><br>Connect to the Microsoft Excel <strong>WHO Life Expectancy, Mortality, &amp; Health Expenditure</strong> Data source.</p>
<p>Rename the Sheet1 Worksheet tab: <strong>Table Lens: Healthcare Variables.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Create a Table Lens Chart.</strong></p>
<p>Drag the following Measures onto the Columns shelf: <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Life Expectancy at Birth (years) (2015)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Neonatal Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births) (2015)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Under-Five Mortality Rate (Probability of Dying by the Age of 5 per 1,000 live births)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Health Expenditure per Capita (US$) (2014)</p>
<p>Drag the Country from the Dimensions onto the Rows shelf.</p>
<p>Click the T icon from the toolbar to add labels to the bars in the chart.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Sort the Data.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Highlight the first column&nbsp;in the header area (Life Expectancy at Birth..)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Sort icon appears when hovering over the first header.<br>&nbsp;Click the Sort icon&nbsp;to sort in descending order.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.&nbsp; Filter the Data</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Drag the <strong>WHO region</strong> dimension to the Filter shelf.<br>&nbsp; Click the <strong>Africa</strong> checkbox and then OK.</p>
<p>To show the filter that allows the viewer to choose a filter value, click the down arrow of the Who region in the Filter shelf and choose Show Filter.&nbsp; You may have to hide the Show Me panel to see the filter.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Edit the axes</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;If two measures have the same unit type, in order to make sure the length of bars are proportional, you may have to change the range of the axes.</p>
<p>Right-click the Under-Five Mortality Rate header and choose Edit Axis.&nbsp; &nbsp; Choose Fixed Range and set the Fixed end to be the nearest whole number (200).<br>Right-click the&nbsp; Neonatal Mortality Rate header and choose Edit Axis.&nbsp; Choose the Fixed Range and set the same Fixed end value (200).<br>This will make both column bars proportional to the max range.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.&nbsp; Format the Chart.</strong></p>
<p>For each of the first three columns in the table lens, right-click the pill in the Columns shelf and format the values.&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose Format -&gt;Number(Custom).&nbsp; Change Decimal places to 0.</p>
<p>For the Health Expenditures... column, right-click the pill in the Columns shelf and format the values.&nbsp; <br>Choose Format -&gt; Currency(Custom).&nbsp; Change Decimal places to 0.<br><br>Right-click on the x-axis of the Health Expenditures column, choose Format-&gt; Currency (Custom), Change Decimal places to 0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Adjust the height of the x axis to display the entire title of each section. <br>&nbsp;Hide the Country row header by right-clicking and choosing: Hide Field Labels for Rows.<br>&nbsp;Change the size of the view of the chart by using the drop-down arrow in the menu from Standard to Entire View.</p>
<p>Hover over the Who region in the right filter and using the down arrow select Customize.&nbsp; <br>Uncheck the <strong>Show ""All"" Value</strong> to avoid the problem of compressing&nbsp; the view too much.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7. Creating a Set.</strong></p>
<p>Because there are many countries in the rows of data, it could be helpful to create groupings or sets.</p>
<p>Hold down Control Key and click the row for&nbsp;<strong>Mauritania</strong> and <strong>South Africa</strong> to highlight.<br>A tooltip will appear,&nbsp; Choose the Set Icon and select Create Set.&nbsp; Name the set: Mauritania/South Africa.<br>Notice a new field is displayed in the Sets section below the Measures.&nbsp; Drag the&nbsp;Mauritania/South Africa field to the Color Marks card.<br>Click the down carrot in the In/OUT(Mauritania/South Africa ) color legend and choose Edit Colors.&nbsp; Change IN to be Orange and OUT to be Blue.</p>
<p>To hide the In/Out color legend hover over the color legend heading and choose the down arrow and ""Hide Card"".</p>
<p><strong>Step 8.&nbsp; Change the chart title.</strong></p>
<p>Change the chart Title to be: <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>WHO Life Expectancy, Neonatal Mortality, Under-Five Mortality, Health Expenditures by Country</strong></span></p>
<p>The completed chart for Part A should resemble the image below:</p>

<p><strong>Tableau 5: Healthcare Costs Table Lens (Video Overview)</strong></p>
<p>In Part B, you will complete a similar example of creating a Table Lens following the same steps as used in Part A.<br>You will use the Healthcare Costs Excel data source for this part of the assignment.<strong><br><br>Step 1:&nbsp; Add an new Worksheet.</strong></p>
<p>Click to add a new Worksheet tab.</p>
<p>In the new Worksheet, choose a New Data Source from the Data menu, browse to find the<strong> Healthcare Costs</strong> Excel file.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:&nbsp;</strong> Rename the Worksheet.</p>
<p>Rename the Worksheet tab: <strong>Table Lens: Healthcare Costs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:&nbsp; Create the Table Lens chart.</strong></p>
<p>Add the Insurer Cost, Patient Cost, and Total Cost measures to the Columns shelf.</p>
<p>Add the Disease dimension to the Rows shelf.</p>
<p>Add labels to the table lens chart.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> <strong>Show a Filter for the chart.</strong></p>
<p>Drag the Disease dimension to the Filter shelf.&nbsp; Use the down arrow to <strong>Show Filter</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>:&nbsp;<strong> Sort the chart.</strong></p>
<p>Sort the chart in descending order by the Total Cost column.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Edit the axes.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;If two measures have the same unit type, in order to make sure the length of bars are proportional, you may have to change the range of the axes.&nbsp; Notice the Patient Cost range is 0 - 60 million and the Insurer Cost and Total Cost columns range is about 0 - 600 million.&nbsp; We need to normalize the range of the columns by changing the range of the Patient Cost column.</p>
<p>Right-click the Patient Cost header and choose Edit Axis.&nbsp; &nbsp; Choose Fixed Range and set the Fixed end to be the nearest whole number (600,000,000).<br>Now all three column bars will be proportional with a max range of about 600,000,000.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Create a Set.</strong><br>Create a set by highlighting the Osteoarthritus and Rheumatoid Arthritus rows with the Control key held down.&nbsp; Name the set: Arthitus.&nbsp; Drag the set to the Color marks card.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 7.&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Format the chart</strong><br>Format the values in the pane, for the three columns as Custom currency with 0 Decimal places.</p>
<p>Format the values in the x-axis, for all three columns as Currency(Custom) with 0 Decimal places and Units Millions.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Change the chart title.</strong></p>
<p>Change the chart title to: <strong>Healthcare Cost Comparisons.</strong></p>
<p>The completed chart should resemble the image below:</p>

<p><strong>Tableau 6: Histogram Intro and Patient Ages Histogram (Video Overview)</strong></p>
<h3><span style=""color: #02075d;""><strong>Part A- Patient Ages Histogram</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Step 1.&nbsp; Create a new Workbook.</strong><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Create a new Tableau Workbook.</p>
<p>Choose to Connect to a Microsoft Excel data source.<br>Connect to the <strong>Clinic Patients Metrics&nbsp;</strong>Excel file.</p>
<p>Change the Sheet1 tab to be: <strong>Histogram: Patient Ages</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Creating Bins</strong><br><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Note:</strong> When creating a bin be sure to choose a size of bin that provides a small enough&nbsp; detailed distribution, &nbsp;but not too small.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Bin dialog, clicking on the Load button can provide you Min, Max and Diff values to help you choose a bin size.<br><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Right-click the<strong> Age&nbsp;</strong>in Measures data area and choose <strong>Create</strong> and select <strong>Bins</strong>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Change the <strong>Bin size</strong> to <strong>10</strong>.&nbsp; Then OK.</p>
<p>A new dimension should now be added called <strong>Age(bin)</strong>.&nbsp; A bin is a bucket or range of continuous values.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Create the Histogram.</strong></p>
<p>Drag the Age&nbsp;from Measures to the Rows shelf.&nbsp; The default aggregation used for Age is SUM(Age).&nbsp; We want to use the Count of the Age. In the Age pill on the Rows shelf, use the down arrow and go to Measure(Sum) and change to Count.&nbsp; The pill should now show CNT(Age).</p>
<p>From the <strong>Show Me</strong> options, click the <strong>Histogram</strong> chart.&nbsp; The Bar Chart should now be changed to a Histogram with your Age(bins) on the Column shelf and the CNT(Age) on the Row shelf.</p>
<p>The Histogram should not have any spaces between the bars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Format the Histogram.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;It would be nice to show the age ranges on the X axis labels.&nbsp; We can do this by creating Aliases for these labels.</p>
<p>Right-click the Age(bin) in the Dimensions and select <strong>Aliases</strong>.<br>You will see two columns.&nbsp; The left column will be the original value the right column will hold the alias label.&nbsp; Click each value and change the value in the right column&nbsp; to be: <strong>20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+&nbsp;</strong> then click OK.</p>
<p>Drag the Age(bin) Dimension to the<strong> Label Marks Card</strong> to add the alias labels to the Histogram.</p>
<p>Right-Click on the y axis and select <strong>Edit Axis</strong>.&nbsp; Change the title to be: <strong>Number of Patients</strong>.</p>
<p>Right-click on X Axis and choose <strong>Edit Axis</strong>.&nbsp; Delete the Age(bin) from the Title.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.&nbsp; Set the Histogram Title.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Change the Histogram title to be:<strong> Age Distribution of Clinic Patients</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The completed Patient Ages Histogram should resemble the cart below:</p>

<p><strong>Tableau 6: Patient Weights Histogram (Video Overview)</strong></p>
<h3><span style=""color: #02075d;""><strong>Part B: On Your Own - Patient Weights Histogram</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>Step 1.&nbsp; Add a Worksheet.<br></strong>Add another Sheet to your workbook.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br></strong>This Histogram will use the same <strong>ClinicPatientsMetrics.xlsx</strong> data source as Part A.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set the Sheet tab name: <strong>Histogram: Patient Weights.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:&nbsp; Creating the Histogram for Weight Distribution</strong></p>
<p>Using the same process we did for the first Histogram, create a Histogram (not a bar chart) using the Weight(kg) Measure as our Continuous measure.</p>
<p>The resulting Histogram should not have any spaces between the bars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:&nbsp; Format your Histogram.</strong></p>
<p>Add Aliases to the histogram Weight (kg)(bin) Dimension.<br>Right-click the Weight (kg)(bin) in the Dimensions and select <strong>Aliases</strong>.<br>Add aliases as shown in the completed chart below.</p>
<p>Drag the Weight (kg)(bin) Dimension to the<strong> Label Marks Card</strong> to add the alias labels to the Histogram.</p>
<p>Change the y-axis header title to be: <strong>Number of Patients</strong>.</p>
<p>Right-click on X Axis and choose <strong>Edit Axis</strong>.&nbsp; Delete the Weight(kg) (bin) from the Title.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.&nbsp; Change the chart title.</strong></p>
<p>Change the chart title to be: <strong>Distribution of Patient Weights (kg)</strong>.</p>
<p>Your completed Patient Weights histogram chart should resemble the one below:</p>

<p><strong>Tableau 7- Line Chart (Video Overview)</strong></p>
<h3><span style=""color: #02075d;""><strong>Part A - Flu Occurrences Line Chart</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>Step 1. Create a new Workbook.</strong></p>
<p>Open a new Tableau Workbook.<br>Connect with a Microsoft Excel data source.<br>Browse to find the <strong>&nbsp;FluOccurrences</strong>&nbsp;Excel file.</p>
<p>Change the Sheet1 Worksheet tab to be: <strong>Line: Flu Occurrences</strong>.<br>&nbsp; <br><strong>Step 2.&nbsp; Create a Line Chart.</strong></p>
<p>Drag<strong>&nbsp;Date</strong>&nbsp;from the Dimensions to the Columns shelf.<br>Click the + symbol in the left of the Year to add Quarter.&nbsp; <br>Click the + symbol to the left of the Quarter to add Month.<br>Remove the Year(Date) and Quarter(Date) pills from the Columns shelf.</p>

<p><strong>Tableau 7 - Part B (Video Overview)</strong></p>
<h3><strong><span style=""color: #000080;""><span style=""color: #02075d;"">Part B: Healthcare Costs Line Chart with Filtering and Sorting</span></span></strong></h3>
<p>We will use the <strong>Healthcare Costs</strong> Excel from a previous assignment as the data source to demonstrate how you can add filtering and sorting to a line chart.&nbsp; This data source will use the Age measure as the continuous measure on the x axis of the line chart.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; Be careful because Tableau wants to apply the SUM aggregate function to Age, and the SUM of Ages is not meaningful in this context.&nbsp; We will use the MAX aggregate instead to represent the max age of each patient record.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Add a new Worksheet.</strong></p>
<p>Add a new worksheet to the project.&nbsp; In the Data menu choose Add New Data Source.<br>Select the Microsoft Excel data source and browse and find the <strong>HealthcareCosts</strong> excel file.<br><br>Name the worksheet: <strong>Line: Healthcare Costs</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.&nbsp; Create a Chart.</strong></p>
<p>From the Data menu, select Add new Data Source.&nbsp; Choose the <strong>HealthcareCosts.xlsx</strong> from your MyTableau repository.<br>Add the <strong>Age</strong> measure to the Columns shelf.&nbsp; Notice the aggregate measure in this pill is SUM.<br>Right-Click on the Age pill and select Measure(SUM) and change the aggregate function to <strong>MAX</strong>.<br>The Age pill should now show MAX(Age) on the Columns shelf.<br><br>Add the <strong>Total Cost</strong> measure to the Rows shelf.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.&nbsp; Dis-aggregating Total Cost.</strong></p>
<p>Notice there is just a single value on the chart for the Total Cost.&nbsp; <br>If you hover your mouse on the circle you can see Tableau is <br>aggregating the Total Cost for all patient records into this one value.</p>
<p>Instead we want to show the Total Cost measure for each patient record on our chart so we will dis-aggregate the records.&nbsp; From the Analysis menu, Click to un-check the <strong>Aggregate Measures</strong>.</p>
<p>Now we a circle for each of the 250 patient records.</p>
<p>Drag <strong>Disease</strong> to the Color Marks card.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.&nbsp; Change chart to Line Chart.</strong><br>Instead of seeing the chart as a Scatter Plot chart, we want to change it to a line chart.</p>
<p>In the Marks Card, where it is showing Automatic, in the drop down choose <strong>Line</strong>.</p>
<p>You should now see the line chart showing Total Cost by Age for each Disease.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.&nbsp; Formatting and Sorting Line Chart.</strong></p>
<p>In the <strong>Total Cost</strong> pill format the y axis to be Custom Currency with 0 Decimal places and Display units Millions.</p>
<p>If we want to see the Diseases in descending order of Total Costs, in the Disease Legend, select to Sort.</p>
<p>Select Sort Order: <strong>Descending</strong>, Field: <strong>Total Cost</strong>, Aggregation: <strong>Sum</strong>.</p>
<p>You should now see the Diseases sorted in descending order.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.&nbsp; Filter to show Top 5 Diseases by Total Costs.</strong></p>
<p>If we want to only show the <strong>Top 5 Disease</strong> by Total Costs, drag the Disease dimension to the Filter Mark card.</p>
<p>Set by field: <strong>Top 5</strong>, <strong>Total Cost</strong>, <strong>Sum</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7.&nbsp; Change the chart title.</strong></p>
<p>Change the chart title to be: Top 5 Diseases by Total Costs and Age.</p>
<p>Your completed Healthcare Costs Line Chart should resemble:</p>

<h3><span style=""color: #5e0833;""><strong>Assignment Overview:</strong></span></h3>
<p>In this assignment we will explore some of the lesser-known chart types: Sparklines, Area charts, Scatter Plots, Filled and Symbol Maps.</p>
<p>Sparklines allow several lines to be used near each other to create a group of information that belongs together and eases the burden of understanding. We will add reference bands to our patient vitals sparklines showing the normal range of values for each of the vital signs. Area charts can be used as a way to represent parts of the whole while keeping the area under the lines separate.&nbsp; Scatter Plots show details in a grid where trend lines, and reference bands can be used to increase understanding.&nbsp; Maps can help place information in its geographical location.&nbsp; Tableau has Filled Maps and Symbol Maps.&nbsp; We will also learn how to make use of layers in our maps.</p>

<p><strong>Tableau 10: Pie Chart and Donut Chart (Video Overview)<br><br></strong></p>
<h4><strong><span style=""font-size: 18pt; color: #02075d;"">Part A:&nbsp; Pie Charts:</span><br></strong></h4>
<h4>Pie Charts may be out of favor with many of the Data Analytics gurus, but many managers and clients still want to see them as an option in a presentation or dashboard.&nbsp; Make sure you limit how many pie slices you show, add legible labels, and look at showing values as Percent of Total.<strong><br></strong></h4>
<p><strong> Step 1. Create a Pie Chart</strong><br>In Tableau connect to the <strong>HealthcareCosts</strong> Excel file in your Tableau Repository.&nbsp; <br>Rename Sheet 1: <strong>Pie Chart: Healthcare Costs</strong><br>Hold Control down and click on Disease from Dimensions and Total Costs from Measures.&nbsp; In the Show me choose Pie Chart.</p>
<p>From the Toolbar change from Standard View to <strong>Entire View</strong> to increase the size of the Pie Chart.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Format the Pie Chart</strong><br>Drag Total Cost to Label Mark. <br>In the Label Mark, in the Sum(Total Cost), add the <strong>Quick Calculation -&gt; Percent of Total.</strong> <br>In the Label Mark, in the Sum(Total Cost) pill, format it to be Percent with 1 Decimal place.<br>While still in the formatting pane format the Label text by bolding it and increasing the size to 10.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:&nbsp; Sort and Filter the Pie Chart</strong><br>Sort the Pie Chart in descending order by Total Cost by choosing the descending sort icon from the Toolbar.<br>The Pie Chart sections should now be arranged in descending order.<br>Drag the Disease Dimension to the Filters Mark.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the <strong>Top</strong> tab.&nbsp; Click by Field, change to <strong>Top 7</strong>, by Total Cost Sum.&nbsp; Click OK.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should now see your Pie Chart limited to only showing the Top 7 sections.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:&nbsp; Complete Pie Chart Fine Tuning</strong><br>Hide the SUM(Total Cost) Legend by choosing Hide Card from the down arrow menu.<br>For each Pie section.&nbsp; Click the section and move the label onto the section.<br>In the Size Mark, use the slider to increase the size of the Pie Chart.<br>Rename the Chart Title: <strong>Diseases by Top 7 Total Costs</strong>.</p>
<p>Your final Pie chart should resemble this&nbsp;chart below:</p>

<p>Fig. 1. Pie Chart: Diseases by Top 7 Total Costs</p>
<h4><span style=""font-size: 18pt; color: #02075d;""><strong>Part B: Donut Chart</strong></span></h4>
<p>Tableau does not include a version of the Pie Chart known as a Donut Chart as one of the build-in chart types available in the Show Me options.&nbsp; We will use two Pie Charts and Dual Axis to create a Donut Chart affect.&nbsp; The same recommendations given for best practices with Pie Charts apply to Donut Charts.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Duplicate the Pie Chart</strong><br>Duplicate the Pie Chart: Healthcare Costs.<br>Rename the new Sheet: <strong>Donut Chart: Healhcare Costs</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #e03e2d;"">Step 2: Create new Number of Records calculated field.</span></strong></p>

<h4><span style=""font-size: 18pt; color: #02075d;""><strong>Part C:&nbsp; Packed Bubble Chart</strong></span></h4>
<p>A Packed Bubble chart can be used to show a Dimension by one or more Measure.&nbsp; One of the Measures will determine the size of the bubbles.&nbsp; The other Measures will appear as Label information on the bubbles.&nbsp; This type of chart cannot represent negative Measures.&nbsp; If the bubble sizes are too small, the labels will not appear. Similar to Pie and Donut Charts, you may want to limit the number of bubbles you display. You may want to add additional Measures as Labels to increase the information at a glance.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.&nbsp; Creating a Packed Bubble Chart.</strong></p>
<p>Add another Sheet: Packed Bubble: Healthcare Costs.<br>Use Control and select Disease Dimension and Per Patient Cost Measure.&nbsp; From the Show Me options select a Packed Bubble chart.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.&nbsp; Adding Labels to Packed Bubbles.</strong></p>
<p>Drag the Per Patient Cost measure to the Label Mark.&nbsp; Format the Label in the Pane to be Currency (Custom) 0 Decimals, and Units Thousands.<br>Drag the Total Cost Measure to the Label Mark, Format this Label in the Pane to be Currency (Custom) 0 Decimals, and Units Thousands.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Filter the Packed Bubbles.</strong></p>
<p>Notice now all the labels do not display on the Packed Bubbles.<br>Drag <strong>Disease</strong> Dimension to the Filters Mark.<br>Click on Top tab and choose By Field.&nbsp; Set <strong>Top 7</strong> by <strong>Per Patient Cost</strong> Sum.&nbsp; Click OK.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:&nbsp; Complete the Chart.</strong><br>Change the title to be: <strong>Disease by Top 7 Per Patient Costs</strong>.</p>
<p>The resulting Bubble Chart should resemble:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/553660/files/113404879/download?verifier=sZ0rdoUyz3DbEUgZB0Ci5LdONkW9NJHqnMuEkHsp&amp;wrap=1"" alt=""InClass10C"" width=""543"" height=""390"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/553660/files/113404879"" data-api-returntype=""File""></p>
<p>Fig. 6. Packed Bubble Chart: Disease by Top 7 Patient Costs</p>
<h4><span style=""font-size: 18pt; color: #02075d;""><strong>&nbsp;Part D: Word Cloud (Wordle) Chart</strong></span></h4>
<p>A Word Cloud or Wordle is a chart where the size of words is used to represent the frequency or size of the corresponding Dimension.&nbsp; We can create a Word Cloud in Tableau from a Table or Pie Chart where a Dimension and Measure are used together.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.&nbsp; Duplicate the Pie Chart Worksheet.&nbsp;</strong> <br>Rename the sheet: Word Cloud: Healthcare Costs.<br><strong>Step 2.&nbsp; Change the Label.<br></strong>Drag the Disease Dimension to the Label Mark card.&nbsp; Remove the <strong>Total Costs</strong> from the Label Mark card.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Creating the Word Cloud.</strong><br>In the Marks Card use the drop down arrow by the Pie symbol and change to <strong>Text</strong>.<br>This will change the chart to a Text or Word Cloud.&nbsp; The Word Labels will be Disease sized by the Sum (Total Costs).<br>Format the Sum(Total Cost) pill in the Size Mark to be Currency (Custom) with 0 Decimal places and Units Millions.&nbsp; <br>This will format the Total Cost that appears in the Tooltip.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Final Formatting.</strong><br>If you want to change the colors of the Diseases in the Legend so some of the words are not so light, you can do that.<br>Set the title to be:<strong> Diseases by Total Cost</strong>.<br>You can modify the Title Formatting so it stands out from the Words in the chart.<br>Right-Click on the Title and choose Format Title.&nbsp; Add a color for shading.<br>Right-Click the Title and choose Edit Title to change the font color to white and bold and increase the size of the font.</p>
<p>The resulting Word Cloud should resemble:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/553660/files/113404789/download?verifier=JT406yxfPLkkke4yS9zarKr7eXuPdE4r1JHYqGSK&amp;wrap=1"" alt=""InClass10D"" width=""590"" height=""314"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/553660/files/113404789"" data-api-returntype=""File""></p>
<p>Fig. 7. Word Chart: Disease by Total Cost</p>
<h4><span style=""font-size: 18pt; color: #02075d;""><strong>Part E: Tree Map&nbsp;</strong></span></h4>
<p>Tree Maps can be used to represent data with nested rectangles.&nbsp; Similar to Packed Bubbles, the rectangles in a Treemap are a Dimension that is sized by a Measure.&nbsp; You can add multiple Measure Labels to display more values in the rectangles, but they are only sized by one Measures.&nbsp; Also similar to Packed Bubbles and Pie Charts, a Tree Map cannot display negative values in the sizing Measure.&nbsp; To compensate for this, Tableau uses a rectangle with a Lable summarizing the number of negative values.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Creating a Tree Map.<br></strong>Add a new Sheet and rename the tab: <strong>Tree Map: Healthcare Costs.</strong><br>Use Control and select <strong>Disease</strong> Dimension and <strong>Total Costs</strong> Measure.&nbsp; <br>From the Show Me options select the <strong>Tree Map</strong> Chart type.<br><br><strong>Step 2:&nbsp; A</strong>dding Labels to the Tree Map.<br>Drag the Total Cost Measure to the Label Mark.<br>Drag the <strong>Insurer Cost</strong> Measure to the Label Mark.<br>Drag the <strong>Patient Cost</strong> Measure to the Label Mark.<br>Rearrange the Label pills with Patient Cost first, then Insurer Cost and finally the Total Cost.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Formatting the Tree Map.</strong><br>Format each of these Labels as Currency (Custom) with 0 Decimal places and Units Millions.<br>Add additional text information to the Labels by clicking on the Label Mark.<br>In the Text area click the ... to open the Edit Label dialog.&nbsp; Add the field information in front of the default values for all labels except the Disease label as shown below.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080; font-size: 14pt;""><strong><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/553660/files/113404870/download?verifier=LrTkYayXBi0VPxGDxqvZ24OisDISUpGPVzSRQOvI&amp;wrap=1"" alt=""InClass10F"" width=""406"" height=""245"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/553660/files/113404870"" data-api-returntype=""File""></strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"">Fig. 8. Tree Map: Formatting Labels</span></p>
<p>Now the additional text will appear in the labels of the rectangles in the Tree Map along with the values.<br>You can also add additional text to the Tooltip.&nbsp; You can click on the Tooltip Mark to bring up the Edit Tooltip dialog.</p>
<p>Add additional text in front of the Field names in the dialog as shown in the image below.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080; font-size: 14pt;""><strong><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/553660/files/113404861/download?verifier=xXWOWHIhKOZ0TE7y64JAtI77XDxaAujHirjvlQEA&amp;wrap=1"" alt=""InClass10E"" width=""418"" height=""313"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/553660/files/113404861"" data-api-returntype=""File""></strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"">Fig. 9.&nbsp; Tree Map: Completing Label Formatting</span></p>
<p>This Text will then appear in the Tooltip when you mouse over the rectangle in the Tree map.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.&nbsp; Final changes to the Tree Map.</strong></p>
<p>You can change the color used for the Tree Map in the legend.&nbsp; Change the color to something besides Blue.&nbsp; I used green in this example.<br>Change the chart title to be: <strong>Diseases by Total Costs</strong>.<br><br>Your final Tree Map should resemble:</p>

<h3><span style=""color: #5e0833;""><strong>Assignment Overview:</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Read this online article <strong><a title=""M14: Read [Creating and Using Calculated Fields]"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/553660/pages/m14-read-creating-and-using-calculated-fields"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/553660/pages/m14-read-creating-and-using-calculated-fields"" data-api-returntype=""Page"">M14: Read [Creating and Using Calculated Fields]</a> </strong>to help understand how calculated fields are used in Tableau.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Some Calculated Field Basics:</strong></span></p>
<p>Creating calculated fields can allow you to extend the capability of your analysis and go beyond simple use of dimensions and measures.&nbsp; You can begin a new calculated field by just opening the dialog Calculated fields allows you to extend by looking at these types of Calculated Fields:</p>
<p>Logical Functions<br>Number Functions<br>Date Functions<br>String Functions<br>Type Conversion<br>Aggregated Functions</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Naming the Calculated Field:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Replace the default calculated field name Calculation 1 with a meaningful calculation name. The newly created calculated field will be added to either the Dimensions or Measures, so giving it a meaningful name will help define its future use.&nbsp; <br></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #5e0833;""><strong>Formulas:</strong></span></p>
<p>The formula editor box is where you construct the formula for a calculated field.&nbsp; It includes a validation tool that will let you know if your formula is valid or there is an error.&nbsp; The text in your formula is also color coded to help you to decode the parts of your formula.<br>You can click the left arrow on the right margin to expand to see the Function choices.&nbsp; You can see All the built-in functions or choose a category of functions to see.&nbsp; A nice description of the parameters for each of the functions is also shown.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #5e0833;""><strong>Field Names:</strong></span><br>You can make use of Fields in building a calculation.&nbsp; Either type the field name or drag it from the Dimensions or Measures area into your calculation.&nbsp; You can right-click on a field you want to use and choose Create-&gt;Calculated Field and it will automatically include that field in the calculation.</p>
<p>Field names are <strong><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">Orange</span></strong> in the formulas.<br>Field Names are included in [ ].</p>
<p><span style=""color: #5e0833;""><strong>Operators:</strong></span><br>Type any necessary operator into your formula.&nbsp; All standard operators such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) are supported.<br>Operators are colored <strong>Black</strong> in the formula.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #5e0833;""><strong>Functions:</strong></span><br>There are many build-in functions available in Tableau.&nbsp; You can click the right&nbsp;caret at the right edge of the calculation editor to expose the list of build-in&nbsp;functions and calculation categories. Functions are <strong><span style=""color: #0000ff;"">Blue</span></strong> in the formula.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #5e0833;"">Comments:</span><br></strong>To add a comment to a calculation, type two forward slash characters into the formula pane.&nbsp; Comments are <strong><span style=""color: #808080;"">Gray</span></strong> in the formula.<br>//<span style=""color: #808080;"">Example Comment</span></p>

<p><strong>Tableau 11: Part A and Part B (Video Overview)</strong></p>
<h3><span style=""color: #5e0833;""><strong>Part A:&nbsp; Number Functions</strong></span><strong></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Step 1.&nbsp; Setting up the Datasource.</strong></p>
<p>Open Tableau with a <strong>Microsoft Excel Datasourc</strong>e.&nbsp; Browse to find the <strong>Sample-Superstore</strong> Excel file in your Tableau Repository.</p>
<p>Drag the <strong>Orders Query</strong> into the <strong>Drag Sheet Here</strong> area to select this Query result.</p>
<p>Rename Sheet1:<strong> Number Function: Wait Time<br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2.&nbsp; Calculating Wait Time using a Date Fields<br></strong></p>
<p>We will create a Calculated field by subtracting the Order Date from the Ship Date.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>This is a row calculation in that the value is calculated for each row in the data set.<br>Right-click on the <strong>Ship Date</strong> Dimension and choose <strong>Create-&gt; Calculated Field.</strong><br>Set the calculated field name : <strong>Wait Time</strong><br>Calculation formula will be: <strong>[Ship Date] - [Order Date]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If the calculation is correct you will receive a message ""<span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>The calculation is valid</strong>.""</span>.&nbsp; Otherwise you will receive the message ""<span style=""color: #ff0000;"">Calculation contains errors</span>"" which means there is some syntax error that must be fixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The new calculated field will be placed as a Measure,&nbsp; Drag the <strong>Wait Time</strong> from Measures area to Dimensions area.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.&nbsp; Creating a Text Table that uses the Wait Time calculated field.<br></strong></p>
<p>Drag the Order ID Dimension to Rows shelf.&nbsp; If asked choose to&nbsp;<strong>Add all members</strong>.<br>Drag the <strong>Wait Time</strong> Dimension to the Rows shelf to the right of the Order ID.<br>Drag the Sales Measure to the Label Mark card.&nbsp; Format the Sum(Sales) as Currency.</p>
<p>Drag <strong>Order ID</strong> Dimension to the Filters Mark.&nbsp; Sort the Order ID in <strong>Descending</strong> order <strong>by Field</strong> and choose <strong>Wait Time</strong> as set the Aggregation to be<strong> Maximum</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set the Text Table title to be: <strong>Order Sales by Longest Wait Time</strong>.</p>
<p>The text table should resemble:</p>
<p><span style=""color: #800080;""><strong><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/553660/files/113404768/download?verifier=GlVJCPIKDpbvWgGJ0MO2X2nIwyM87JkoBuJCfYnP&amp;wrap=1"" alt=""Wait Time Calculation"" width=""498"" height=""376"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/553660/files/113404768"" data-api-returntype=""File""></strong></span></p>

<h3><span style=""color: #5e0833;""><strong>Part B:&nbsp; String Functions</strong></span><strong></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open Tableau with a <strong>Microsoft Excel&nbsp;Datasource</strong> and Browse to find the <strong>CustomerData.xlsx</strong> file.</p>
<p>Rename the first Sheet 1: <strong>String Function:&nbsp;Concatenation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: String Concatenation</strong></p>
<p>If you want to combine the parts of a&nbsp;name into one string, you can use the '+' concatenation operator to join fields into one string.&nbsp; String concatenation can only be done on string data types.&nbsp; So for example, if you are trying to concatenate a city and zipcode together, you may have to change the data type of the zip code if it is a number before you can concatenate it to the city.</p>
<p>There are several ways you could combine parts of a name.&nbsp; First Name space Last Name.&nbsp; Last Name coma space First Name, etc.&nbsp; Our first string calculation will combine First and Last Name.<br>Right-Click on&nbsp;<strong>First Name</strong> field in Dimensions and choose Create-&gt;Calculated Field.&nbsp; This will bring up the edit Calculation dialog.&nbsp; Now we can concatenate the First Name which is a string to&nbsp;the Last Name.</p>
<p>Set the calculated field name: <strong>Full Name</strong><br>Calculation formula will be:&nbsp;<strong>[First Name]+ ""&nbsp; ""+[Last Name]</strong></p>
<p>Notice now there is a new Dimension called <strong>Full Name.</strong>&nbsp; <br>Drag the <strong>Full Name</strong>&nbsp;Dimension to the <strong>Rows</strong> shelf.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Click to Add All Members.&nbsp;<br></strong>You can now see the&nbsp;Full Name as a combined string of First Name and Last Name separated by a space.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Create a Text Table that uses the Full Name calculated field. <br></strong></p>
<p>Drag the <strong>Yearly Income</strong>&nbsp;Measure to the Label Mark.&nbsp; In the<strong> Show Me</strong> options change the chart type to be <strong>Text Table</strong>.<br>Change the Aggregate Function in the Label Mark&nbsp;<strong>Sum(Yearly Income)</strong> pill&nbsp; to be <strong>Measure(Sum) -&gt; Maximum</strong>.&nbsp; This now shows the Full Name of the customers by their Max(Yearly Income).</p>
<p>Format the <strong>Max(Yearly Income)</strong> Label to be Currency(Custom) with 0 Decimal places.</p>
<p>Sort the <strong>Full Name</strong> pill on the Rows shelf to be descending order by the Field&nbsp; <strong>Yearly Income</strong> by Aggregation <strong>Maximum</strong>.</p>
<p>Change the title of the table: <strong>Customers by Maximum Yearly Income</strong>.</p>
<p>Your table chart should resemble:</p>

<p>Fig. 2. String Function: Concatenation</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:&nbsp; STARTSWITH String Calculation</strong></p>
<p>Add a new Worksheet and name the tab: <strong>String Function: STARTSWITH</strong>.<br>Still using the <strong>CustomerData</strong> as the DataSource for this Worksheet.</p>
<p>You can test to see if a string field begins with alphabetical match using the&nbsp;<strong>STARTSWITH</strong> function.&nbsp; <br>While this calculation is done on a string it actually returns a boolean result. The calculation will return<strong> True i</strong>f the string starts with the letter or string given or False otherwise.&nbsp; The matching test is case-insensitive.<br>Right-click on the <strong>Full Name</strong> Dimension and chose <strong>Create-&gt;Calculated Field</strong>.<br>In front of the field add the function<strong> STARTSWITH</strong> and provide a single letter or string for a match.<br><br>Set the name of the calculated field: <strong>Full Name A?<br></strong>Calculation formula will be:<strong> STARTSWITH([Full Name],""A"")<br><br>Step 4:&nbsp; Create a Text Table that uses the Full Name A? calculated field. </strong><br>Drag the <strong>Full Nam</strong>e Dimension to the Rows shelf.<br>Drag the <strong>Full Name A?</strong> Dimension to the Rows shelf to the right of the<strong> Full Name</strong> pill.<br>Drag the <strong>Gende</strong>r Dimension to the Columns shelf.<br>Choose the <strong>Text Table</strong> from the Show Me options.<br>Drag the <strong>Gender</strong> Dimension to the <strong>Label Marks</strong> card.</p>
<p>Change the chart title to be:<strong> Customers by Gender and First Names Starting with A True/False<br></strong>The completed Text Table should resemble:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1.&nbsp; Date Calculation with DATEDIFF</strong></p>
<p>Add a new Worksheet with the tab name: <strong>Date Function: DATEDIFF</strong>.<br>Still using the <strong>CustomerData</strong> as the DataSource for this Worksheet.</p>
<p>Dates have different date parts including: day, month and year.&nbsp; We can calculate an<strong> Age</strong>&nbsp;in years from a Birth Date&nbsp; by using the <strong>DATEDIFF</strong> Date function.&nbsp; This function subtracts a start_date from an end_date.&nbsp; Our parameters&nbsp;are <strong>DATEDIFF(datepart&nbsp;, start_date, end_date)</strong>.&nbsp; We will also use a build-in function to find the current date <strong>TODAY()</strong> and use this for the end_date.</p>
<p>Right-click on the <strong>Birth Date</strong> Dimension and choose Create-&gt;Calculated Field.<br>Name the new calculated field:<strong> Age</strong><br>Calculation will be: <strong>DATEDIFF('year', [Birthdate], TODAY())</strong></p>
<p>You should now see a new Dimension called<strong> Age.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2.&nbsp; Create a Text Table that uses the Age calculated field.<br></strong></p>
<p>Drag the<strong> Full Name</strong> Dimension to the <strong>Rows</strong> shelf.<br>Drag the <strong>Birthdate</strong> Dimension to the <strong>Rows</strong> shelf.<br>Drag the <strong>Age</strong> Dimension to the <strong>Label Mark</strong> shelf.</p>
<p>Without the age, the user might be required to do the Age calculation given the Birth year in their head.&nbsp; Not very user friendly.&nbsp; With the Age calculated field, the Birth year becomes unnecessary.</p>

<p>Story Points allow the analyst to create a compelling, interactive, data-driven story.&nbsp; Stories are made up of specific views or dashboards in a sequential presentation.</p>
<p>One use of a story would be to walk the audience through the process you used to arrive a final visualization or dashboard.&nbsp; Dashboards can tell you the what, Stories can help explain the why.</p>
<p>In this assignment you will create several charts and include them in a Tableau story.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Tableau 12: Tableau Story (Video Overview)<br></strong></p>
<h4><span style=""font-size: 18pt; color: #02075d;""><strong>Create Charts to use in a Story</strong></span></h4>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Tableau and Connect to a data source.</strong></p>
<p>Open Tableau and choose to Connect to a Microsoft Excel file.<br>Choose the <strong>Sample-Superstore</strong> Excel as the data source.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drag the <strong>Orders</strong> table to the orders area.</p>
<p>Next, we will create some Worksheets that we will use in a Tableau Story.<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Sales &amp; Profit Worksheet.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Begin by naming Sheet 1: <strong>Sales &amp; Profit</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Double click State, brings up a Symbol Map.</p>
<p>Drag Category to the Filter Card.&nbsp; Select All.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right Click the Category in Filter to Show Filter.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Move the Category Filter to just below the marks cards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Drag Profit to the Color Marks card. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drag sales to the Size Marks card.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Regional Products Worksheet</strong><br>Add a new worksheet: <strong>Regional Products</strong><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Drag Category -&gt; Rows shelf.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Drag Sub-category to Rows shelf to the right of Category.<br>&nbsp; Drag Region -&gt;Columns shelf.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; Drag Sales -&gt; Columns shelf to the right of Region.<br>&nbsp; Swap axes using the tool from the toolbar.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Add Profit to Color Marks card.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Add Region to Filters Marks card.&nbsp; Select All.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on Region filter to Show Filter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Format Sales in Rows Shelf Axis as currency with 0 decimals and units thousands.<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: ShipMode/Sales/Profit Worksheet</strong></p>
<p>Add new worksheet: <strong>ShipMode/Sales/Profit</strong>: <br>Drag Sales to -&gt;Columns.&nbsp; Drag&nbsp; Profit to-&gt;Rows&nbsp;</p>
<p>Format the y-axis Profit and x-axis Sales as currency with 0 decimal places.&nbsp; <br>Drag Ship Mode -&gt; Color Marks card.&nbsp; Drag Profit- &gt;Size marks card.<br>Drag Ship Mode-&gt; to Filter, select All.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Profit by Category Worksheet.</strong></p>
<p>Add new worksheet: <strong>Profit by Category.</strong><br>Drag Profit to -&gt; Columns. Drag&nbsp; Category to-&gt; Rows<br>Show Me -&gt; Tree Map View<br>Drag Profit -&gt; Color Marks card&nbsp; <br>Drag Profit-&gt; Size Marks card<br>Drag Sub-Category -&gt; Label Marks card.</p>

<p><strong>Step 8.&nbsp; Adding Story Points</strong></p>
<p>Drag the <strong>Sales&amp;Profit</strong> worksheet to the sheet area of the story.<br>The caption is a box with this default text: Add the caption<br>Modify the caption to be: <strong>Are all product lines profitable?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 9. Duplicate a Story Point</strong></p>
<p>Save your story.&nbsp; Then Duplicate the story Point by clicking the Duplicate button on the left.<br>Filter the Categories to only show the Furniture.<br>Modify the caption to be: <strong>Filtered by Furniture</strong>.<br>Click the little Update symbol above the caption to save these changes in the story point.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9.&nbsp; Adding more Story Points</strong><br><br>Click the<strong> Blank</strong> button to add a new story point.<br>Drag the <strong>Regional Products</strong> worksheet to the sheet area of the story.<br>Filter Region to select South and West.<br>Modify the caption to be: <strong>Sales by South and West Regions</strong>.<br>Drag a Text area from the left to just below the Region filter in your story area.<br>Add the following text: <strong>You may select different regions</strong>.<br>Update the story point by clicking the Update symbol above the caption.</p>
<p>Click<strong> Blank</strong> button to add another story point.<br>Drag the <strong>Ship/Sales/Profit</strong> worksheet to the sheet area of the story.<br>Modify the caption to be: <strong>Standard Class is the most profitable ship mode</strong>.&nbsp; <br>Drag the caption to increase the width or height of the caption as needed.<br>Select the Standard Class circle in the chart.<br>Click the Update symbol above the caption to update this story point.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Blank </strong>button to add another story point.<br>Drag the <strong>Profit by Category</strong> worksheet to the sheet area of the story.<br>Modify the caption to be: <strong>Profit by Category and Sub Category (3 negative values)<br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 10. Reordering Story Points</strong><br>In the Story Point navigation, drag the Standard Class Ship Mode most profitable caption to be after the Profit by Category and Sub Category caption.&nbsp; This reorders the story points. When you are fine tuning your story, it is often helpful to rearrange the order of the story points.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Step 11.&nbsp; Presenting a Story</strong></p>
<p>Move the story progress bar back to the first caption using slider or use the left arrow to rewind the story to the first story point.<br>Click the <strong>Presentation Mode</strong> icon in the Toolbar to run the story in presentation mode.<br>Use the forward and back arrows to navigate the story.<br>Hit the<strong> ESC</strong> button to leave presentation mode.</p>

<h4><strong><span style=""font-size: 18pt; color: #02075d;"">Part C:&nbsp; Cleaning Up an Untidy Excel Data Source</span><br></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Step 6.&nbsp; Using Data Interpreter, Pivot, and Column Splitting on an Untidy Excel File.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes Excel files are not in the proper format to be used as a table in Tableau.&nbsp; Tableau can make use of a Data Interpreter to help resolve some of these Excel file formatting issues.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7. Connect to an Excel data source <br><br></strong>On the Tableau start page, under the Connect header, choose Excel. Select the <strong>WHO Death Projections</strong> Excel file and click Open. Worksheets in Excel are treated as tables in a database. The preview area will populate the data without having to drag and drop anything.<br><br><strong>Step 8.</strong>&nbsp; In the left column, click the checkbox for the <strong>Data Interpreter </strong>Tool. Clicking on the <strong>Review the results </strong>link will open the Excel file. <br>The first tab is the key to the Data Interpreter.<br>The second worksheet displays the actual changes to the file using the key as a reference. <br>Close the Excel file as the file is now properly formatted.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 9. </strong>While the Data Interpreter correctly formats the table and flattens multi-line headers, this does not mean&nbsp; that the data is optimally structured. The table layout is in a cross-tab format which is useful for reporting but not for data analysis.&nbsp; To pivot wide columns into tall rows use the <strong>Pivot Tool</strong>. <br>Click the second column header to select the second column.<br>Scroll all the way to the right and while holding down the Shift key, click the last column header.&nbsp; This will highlight all the columns.<br>Hover over a highlighted column header to make the caret visible.&nbsp; Click the caret to display the submenu.&nbsp; Select ""Pivot"".<br>Pivoting turns multiple wide columns into two tall columns:Pivot Field Names and Pivot Field Values.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10.</strong> Notice the Pivot Field Names column contains multiple values in the one column. This column can be split into three columns: Year, Gender, and Age. To split the column, right-click the Pivot Field Names and choose ""Custom Split"".&nbsp; <br>Place the cursor in the ""Use this Separator"" box and press the Space Bar. This action removes all the greyed out separators and replaces them with a single blank space to use as the separator. <br>For the ""Split off"" select ""Last"" and ""4"" columns.<br>Right-click the F1 column header and choose ""rename"" from the submenu.&nbsp; Rename as ""Cause of Death"".<br>Rename the resulting columns as: ""Year"", ""Gender"", and ""Age Group(years)"".<br>Right-click and hide the Pivot Field Names column. <br>Hide the Pivot Field Name column displaying the word ""years"" in every row.<br>Rename the Pivot field values to ""Projected Deaths per 100,000"".<br>Click ""Go to Worksheet"" to begin analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Step 11.</strong> Rename the worksheet: <strong>Untidy Excel Datasource</strong><br>Add the Age Group Dimension to the Columns shelf.<br>Add the Projected Deaths per 100,000 Measure to the Rows shelf.</p>
<p>Drag the Gender Dimension to the Color mark.<br>Drag the Projected Deaths per 100,000 to the Label mark.<br>Title the sheet: <strong>Projected Deaths by Age Group</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Tableau 3: Part A (Video Overview)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Create a new worksheet in tableau.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Rename the Sheet 1 tab: <strong>Text: Preop Risk Factors</strong></p>
<p><strong>Changing Chart Title:</strong><br>By default a chart title will have the Worksheet title.&nbsp; Right click the chart title to Edit Title. Delete the &lt;Sheet Name&gt; and set the new title to: Preoperative Risk-Factor Rates: Hospital v. Comparison. You can change the font color, font name and size.&nbsp; Select the title text and change format the title.&nbsp; Click OK.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Starting the Analysis.</strong></p>
<p>We will create a Text Table using this data about preoperative risk factors.</p>
<p>From the Dimensions, double-click the Measure Names.&nbsp; This will place the name of each measure as a column heading.</p>
<p>From the Dimensions, double-click the Preoperative Risk Factors.&nbsp; This will add this to the Rows shelf.</p>
<p>Use the Show Me tool to change the chart type to a Text Table with rows and columns.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Filtering columns</strong></p>
<p>There are several columns we are not really interested in: for example Count of Sheet 1.<br>To Filter these columns out of the table, drag the Measure Names from the Dimensions&nbsp; to the Filters box.</p>
<p>Right click and choose Edit Filter. Unselect all checkboxes except Hospital % and Comparison %.&nbsp; Then OK.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Ordering Columns</strong></p>
<p>If we want we can reorder the Hospital and Comparison columns by moving the pills in the Measure Values so the SUM(Hospital %) is above the SUM(Comparison %) pill.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5. Sorting Columns</strong></p>
<p>By default the table is sorted by the Preoperative Risk Factors in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>To resort by Hospital % move your cursor to the Hospital % column heading and a small sort icon will appear.&nbsp; If you click on it you can toggle sorting in ascending or descending order.&nbsp; Notice sorting by Hospital % changes the other two columns.&nbsp; To resort by Preoperative Risk Factors ascending alphabetical click the sort icon in that column heading.</p>
<p>Your completed exercise Part A should look like this:</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Create the Text Table.</strong></p>
<p>Add the Disease dimension to the Rows Shelf.<br>Add the Insurer Costs measure to the Columns Shelf.<br>Add the Patient Costs measure to the Columns Shelf.<br>Add the Total Costs measure to the Column Shelf.</p>
<p>Using the Show Me options, change the chart type to be a Text Table.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>:&nbsp; <strong>Sort the Text Table by Total Costs</strong><br>Sort the Text Table in descending order by Total Costs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:&nbsp; Format the Text Table</strong></p>
<p>Format each of the Measure Values in the Pane area of the Text Table as Currency with 0 Decimal places.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Change the Chart Title.</strong></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Bar charts are one of the most frequently used visualizations.&nbsp; They can be used to trends over time, comparison of different categories, or parts of a whole (stacked bar charts) which are often preferred over pie charts.&nbsp; Bar charts are often aligned either vertically or horizontally. Vertical bar charts are often used when showing trends over time.&nbsp; Horizontal bar charts can be used when differentiating between categories, especially categories with long headings.&nbsp; Stacked bar charts can be used to explore parts of a whole relationships.&nbsp; In this assignment you will make use of each of these types of bar charts and also side by side bar charts.</span></p>

<h4><span style=""color: #02075d; font-size: 18pt;""><strong>Part B: A Side-by-Side Bar Chart</strong></span></h4>
<p>In this section, we will create a side-by-side bar chart using the Patient Falls data source.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> <strong>Add a new worksheet to your workbook.</strong></p>
<p>Add a new worksheet.&nbsp; Rename the worksheet: <strong>Side-by-Side Bar: Patient Falls</strong>.</p>
<p>Again, Connect to the <strong>PatientFalls_SingleHospital</strong> Excel file.</p>
<p>Holding down the Control key, click on the <strong>Type of Care Dimension </strong>and the <strong>Patient Falls No Injury Rate</strong> and the <strong>Patient Falls With Injury Rate</strong> in the Measures.&nbsp; Open the Show Me and choose Side-by-Side bar chart.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Sort the Side-by-Side Bar Chart</strong></p>
<p><span>To sort by only one measure rather than the total of the columns, right-click on the Types of Care pill.&nbsp; Select&nbsp;</span><strong>Sort</strong><span>.&nbsp; Click the&nbsp;</span><strong>Field</strong><span>&nbsp;in the drop down&nbsp; in the Sort by section.&nbsp; From the Field Names drop down list choose&nbsp;</span><strong>Patient Falls with Injury Rates</strong><span>.&nbsp; Click</span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Descending<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span>in the sort order section.&nbsp; Close the dialog with the X in the upper right corner</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 3.&nbsp; Format the Side-by-Side Bar Chart.</strong></p>
<p>Notice the y axis just has the header title of Value.&nbsp; Right-click the y axis and choose Edit Axis.<br>Change the title to be: Rate of Patient Falls (per 1,000 patient days).</p>
<p>Widen the columns labels in the x axis so the header titles are completely visible.&nbsp; This may cause a scrollbar on the x axis to appear.</p>
<p>Hide the x axis header by Right-clicking on Type of Care and choosing Hide Field Labels for Columns.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Change the chart Title.<br></strong></p>
<p>Change the Chart Title to: <strong>Rate of Patient Falls (per 1,000 patient days)- No Injury vs Injury by Type of care FY2017</strong>.</p>
<p>Final worksheet for the Side-by-Side bar chart should resemble:</p>

<h4><span style=""color: #02075d; font-size: 18pt;""><strong>Part C: A Stacked Bar Chart</strong></span></h4>
<p>In this section we will dulicate the side-by-side bar chart to create a Stacked Bar Chart.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Duplicate the Side-By-Side Bar Chart.</strong></p>
<p>Right-Click on the tab for the Side-by-Side Bar and choose Duplicate Sheet, <br>Rename new sheet: <strong>Stacked Bar: Patient Falls</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Create Stacked Bar Chart.</strong></p>
<p>Drag the Measure Names pill off the Columns shelf.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Add Labels and format the chart</strong><br>Add Labels to the chart by clicking on the Labels or T icon on the menu.</p>
<p>In each of the Measure Values pills, format the Labels in Pane tab as Number (Custom) with Decimal place set to 1.</p>
<p>Widen the column headers on the x axis so the header text is visible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.&nbsp; Set the chart title.</strong></p>
<p>Set the title of the chart to be: <span><strong>Rate of Patient Falls (per 1,000 patient days)- No Injury vs Injury by Type of Care sorted by injury, for FY2017</strong>.</span></p>

<h4>Typical vs Unusual</h4>
<p>Which values are the most common? Why?</p>
<p>Which values are rare? Why? Does that match your expectations?</p>
<p>Can you see any unusual patterns? What might explain them?</p>
<h4>Are there Subgroups?</h4>
<p>How are the observations within each groups similar to each other?</p>
<p>How are the observations in separate groups different from each other?</p>
<p>How can you explain or describe the groups?</p>
<p>Why might the appearance of groups be misleading?</p>
<h3>For the multivariate answer the following questions:</h3>
<h4>Patterns: if you spot a pattern, ask yourself:</h4>
<p>Could this pattern be due to coincidence (i.e. random chance)?</p>
<p>How can you describe the relationship implied by the pattern?</p>
<p>How strong is the relationship implied by the pattern?</p>
<p>What other variables might affect the relationship?</p>
<p>Does the relationship change if you look at individual subgroups of the data?</p>

<p>The data set lists the protein consumption of 25 European countries in <strong>percent</strong> (Austria gets 8.9% of its protein from red mean, 19.9% from milk, and so on. You boss is interested in reducing the marketing costs in Europe by changing target marketing each individual country to groups of countries that are similar in their consumption behaviors.&nbsp; You should obtain the following information:</p>
<p>1. Which countries protein consumption is similar (clusters). Descriptively label the clusters.</p>
<p>2. Which is the most representative country for each cluster (k-medoids).</p>
<p><strong>Required:</strong> Include the following in the report: Descriptive Statistics, K-Means Model, K-Mediods Model, Hierarchical Model, tables/visualizations/plots of the Results, Within groups sum of squares plot (elbow plot).</p>
<p><strong>Optional:</strong> Your boss would also like to optimize distribution locations. Using a map of Europe, mark coordinates for each country, and do either a k-mean and/or k-mediods on the best countries for a distribution center based on both geographic location and cluster.</p>
<p><strong>Hints:</strong></p>
<p>1. This dataset has no missing items, the data is also already of the same scale (so it does not need to be standardized). However, it does have a first column with names of countries that you might want to remove before doing the clustering.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: start; margin: 9.0pt 0in 9.0pt 0in;""><span style=""font-family: 'Lato',sans-serif; color: #2d3b45;"">2. When deciding on the business value of clustering it is good to run several different solutions (3, 4, 5 and 6 cluster models) to see if we can find differences in the clusters that have business value. It is all about interpretation and business value. Always put your business hat on and ask does this model help my business.</span></p>

<p><strong>Data Science Project</strong></p>
<p>Project Requirements:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Choose some data that is meaningful to you. I have had many project where students did an analysis with real data for their jobs. Or you could do something that you could use as part of your professional portfolio to be used in job searching. There are thousands of datasets here- <a title=""Important Data Sets and Sites"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/568027/modules/1592783"" data-course-type=""modules"" data-published=""true"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/568027/modules/1592783"" data-api-returntype=""Module"">Important Data Sets and Sites</a>. Your dataset should be substantial (of at least one hundred rows, prefer many hundreds or thousands of rows). Your dataset must be approved by me (no Titanic survivor prediction, no house price prediction, no salary prediction). You may use this dataset if you like.&nbsp; Data: <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file"" title=""TripAdvisorLasVegasReviews.csv"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/568027/files/117245856/download?verifier=sD559yIMCydsAAGYTi3OdxuF9j3G98pXP40WMDmj&amp;wrap=1"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/568027/files/117245856"" data-api-returntype=""File"">TripAdvisorLasVegasReviews.csv</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; Data description: <a class=""instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file"" title=""TripAdvisor Review Project for Las Vegas Hotels.docx"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/568027/files/117246083/download?verifier=gpBg4YwJ8063aUB9pvQSViB4Z41x9f1ZfMqhqP44&amp;wrap=1"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/568027/files/117246083"" data-api-returntype=""File"">TripAdvisor Review Project for Las Vegas Hotels.docx</a></p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> You may <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>only</strong></span> use Python or Orange to do the analysis.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Do at least 2 analyses on the data:</p>
<p>a. one unsupervised (clustering or association)</p>
<p>b. one supervised (either classification or estimation)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A) classification: decision tree, logistic regression, naïve bayes, ensemble</p>

<p><span style=""color: #34495e;""><span style=""font-size: 1rem;""><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #bfedd2;"">Housekeeping Note:</span> when the time comes to run Wireshark, keep it running (capturing packets) through all 4 videos so we can save all the activity into a single PCAP file. Next week, we will analyze this. You can pause the capture as needed if you don't do all 4 assignments in one sitting. If something happens to disrupt the capture (VM crash or you forget to unpause) it won't be necessary to start all over, just keep moving on from that point. While using your own packet capture is preferred, I will be providing you with a PCAP file next week should something not work right with yours.</span></span></p>

The purpose of this Hybrid Activity is allow you to research and learn a little bit about the similarities and differences between SQL Server and other relational database management systems (RDBMS). It will be helpful for you to familiarize yourself with an RDBMS other than the ones we use in class (SQL Server and MySQL)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">To complete this Hybrid Activity, prepare a document addressing the following points.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">1) Pick one of the following RDBMSs to research: Oracle, PostgreSQL, IBM DB2, FileMaker Pro, SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise, Informix.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">2) Identify different editions or version of your chosen database. For example, SQL Server has Express, Developer, Professional, Enterprise, etc. What about the one you chose? Briefly describe what each edition is intended for.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">3) What is your chosen database's equivalent of Management Studio (e.g. MySQL's equivalent is Workbench)?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">4) How broadly is your chosen RDBMS used? Your answer to this may be geographic or scale-related or both (e.g. worldwide, millions of installations).</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">5) What are two or three main strengths or benefits promoted by the maker of your RDBMS? What sets their database apart (at least in their eyes) from the competition?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">6) What are your RDBMS's major drawbacks or weaknesses? (e.g. MySQL's community edition is free and open source, and therefore, does not include any support from a company).</span></p>

Open a new Word document and place your name and the course number at the top.

Use your <strong>INFO4410_HW</strong> instance of SQL Server.</span><br><br><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">1) Download the <strong>AdventureWorks</strong> database file from the <a class=""instructure_file_link inline_disabled"" href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&amp;tabs=ssms"" target=""_blank""><strong>Microsoft SQL Server website</strong></a>. Be sure to get the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>OLTP database file</strong></span>, not the data warehouse or the lightweight database. Using <strong>SQL Server Management Studio</strong>, restore the AdventureWorks database into your HW instance. There are instructions on the Microsoft site linked above. Display the list of databases in your instance to demonstrate that AdventureWorks was attached correctly.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">2) Identify the operating system of the server that your instance is running on.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">3) Set the instance to log both successful and failed login attempts.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">4) Set the instance so that it will use<strong> <em>at least</em> 2GB</strong> of RAM for Server Memory.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">5)&nbsp;Set the instance so that if a query from a remote connection runs for more than one minute, it is timed out.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">6) Set the instance so that if a user enters a date value as '6/12/53', it will be interpreted as June 12th, 2053, rather than as June 12th, 1953. If a user enters a date value as '11/2/54', this date should be interpreted as November 2nd, 1954, not November 2nd, 2054.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">7) Set the instance's server agent to log errors, warnings and information notifications. (<em><strong>Hint: You'll need to configure the Error Logs under SQL Agent</strong></em>).</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">8) Create an alert on your instance that would occur if the AdventureWorks<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong> database's active transactions</strong></span> ever exceed 30 at any given time. You <strong>do not</strong> need to configure Database Mail so that it would actually send, just create the alert.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">9) Enable the <strong>Resource Governor</strong> and ensure that your default resource pool can use <strong>no more than 80%</strong> of your CPU and <strong>no more than 65%</strong> of your RAM.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">10) View your <strong>current server log</strong> and identify how long your instance has been running. That is, what is the date when the instance was last started?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Be sure that you have <strong>clearly labeled</strong> all of your screen shots to correspond with the steps above.

Do not attempt to complete steps 1 through 4 using MySQL Workbench--it won't work because of the MariaDB database variant in XAMPP. Use screenshots in a Word document to <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>demonstrate your completion of each task</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">1) Create a new user named WebApps. Set the WebApps user so that it can only log in on the localhost machine.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">2) Make the password for the WebApps user: M0unt4in$</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">3) Make a new MySQL database called PhoneLog by writing a CREATE DATABASE statement. Create two tables, one called PhoneUsers and one called PhoneCalls. These two tables relate to each other in a one-to-many fashion.</span></p>

<li><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">PhoneUsers should have columns UserID INT (PK) and PersonName VARCHAR(25).</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">PhoneCalls should have columns CallID INT (PK), CallToNumber VARCHAR(14), StartDateTime DATETIME, EndDateTime DATETIME and UserID INT (FK).</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">INSERT a few rows of data in each table. You can just make these up.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">4) Set the database permissions so that WebApps can only SELECT and UPDATE on the two tables in the PhoneLog database. Make sure that the permissions prevent WebApps from doing *anything* in the database globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">5) Log into your MySQL database as the user WebApps to show that your user and permissions configuration work correctly. You can log into MySQL from MySQL Workbench, or from PHPMyAdmin. Make sure you've modified PHPMyAdmin's config.inc.php file to require a username and password if you want to log in and test your WebApps user account using PHPMyAdmin. In the document you submit for this activity, provide clear documentation that you have logged into the database successfully.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">6) Attempt to violate the permissions that you've set up for the WebApps user account by writing SQL statements that try to do things WebApps is not allowed to do, such as create a table, or drop the PhoneLog database, or create a new user. Include <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>multiple screenshots</strong></span> that prove that you can only SELECT or UPDATE on the PhoneLog database.</span></p>

<li><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">BusinessEntityID</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">PersonName (this is a concatenation of LastName, FirstName MiddleName from the Person table)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">PhoneNumber</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">PersonAddress (this is a concatenation of AddressLine1, City, StateProvinceCode CountryRegionCode PostalCode)</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Note that you'll need to access PersonPhone, BusinessEntityAddress, Address and StateProvince in the Person schema to build this concatenation.</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">It may help to look at the AdventureWorks ER diagram, which is available on the Internet. Here is one spot you can see it: <a href=""https://txtrainingstore.blob.core.windows.net/db-backup-aw2019/AdventureWorksERD"">https://txtrainingstore.blob.core.windows.net/db-backup-aw2019/AdventureWorksERD</a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">All needed tables are in the Person schema. Beyond just the ER diagram, here are some additional helps to get the joins that you need set up when creating the view:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">The Person table and the PersonPhone table relate on the BusinessEntityID keys.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">The Person table and the BusinessEntityAddress table relate on the BusinessEntityID keys.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">The BusinessEntityAddress table and the Address table relate on the AddressID keys.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">The Address table and the StateProvince table relate on the StateProvinceID keys.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Run the code to create the view and take a screenshot showing successful creation. SELECT * from the view and take another screenshot showing successful retrieval of data. It should look similar to this:</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Add all needed screenshots to your Word document and label them. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Include the full SQL code you wrote to make the view</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">3) Create a new <strong>Login </strong>for your instance. The Login name will be IndividualDataAccess and the password will be $ecretP4ssw0rd</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Do <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">not</span> enforce the Windows password policy. Set the default database to be AdventureWorks. Do not grant any server roles or map any databases. Take a screenshot to document the creation of the Login and place it in your Word document. Label the screenshot.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">4) Create a new SQL <strong>User </strong>that uses the Login that you just set up for the AdventureWorks database. The name for this User must match the Login's name. Do not grant the user any ownership, membership or permission at this time. Take a screenshot and place it in your Word document. Label the screenshot.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">5) Create a new Role for the AdventureWorks database. The name for this Role will be PersonViewAccess. Configure this role so that the only thing it can do is issue SELECT statements against the PersonAddresses view. Add the IndividualDataAccess User to this Role. Take screenshots showing the Role and its assigned User, and its sole permission. Place all of these into your Word document and label them appropriately.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">6) Disconnect from your HW SQL Server instance in SSMS, and then reconnect using the login IndividualDataAccess with password $ecretP4ssw0rd and ensure that the Object Explorer is visible to <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>show the current logged in User</strong></span>. Write a query to SELECT * from the PersonAddresses view. Take a screenshot, ensuring that you include the Object Explorer with the current logged in user showing, the SQL query and the results below. Include a screenshot showing that your newly created User was able to log in and select from the newly created view. Label this screenshot appropriately.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">7) Write a SQL query to attempt to select, update, insert or delete on any other table or view in the AdventureWorks database. If your Login, User and Role are configured correctly, you should get a ""permission denied"" error when you attempt to do *anything* other than select from the PersonAddresses view. Take a screenshot showing your attempt and permission denied. Place these screenshots into your Word document and label them appropriately.</span></p>

Complete the following steps, showing images and labels for each&nbsp; one:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">1) Connect to your HW instance of SQL Server on your VM. You need to have the AdventureWorks database.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">2) Configure a Performance Monitor window with the following counters added: Memory: Available MBytes; Memory: Pages/sec; Processor: %Processor Time; &lt;Your HW Instance of SQL Server&gt;: Databases: Transactions/sec. Make sure the scale setting for all of your counters is 1.0. Run the Transactions.sql script. While the Transactions script is executing, view the Performance Monitor window. Using screenshots and written explanations, identify how the database, and the work you're having it do when you execute Transactions.sql, impact your VM's server performance. Be specific! Be thorough!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">3) Create a new SQL Server Profiler trace. Run the Transactions.sql script and then show the results of your Profiler trace. Take a screenshot and include it in your report. Write a summary of behavior captured by the trace.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">4) Run the Activity Monitor on your instance. Run the Transactions.sql script again and take screenshots of interesting/notable observations in the Activity Monitor. Summarize your observations in writing.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">5) Run the Transactions.sql script again. While it is executing, generate the ""All Transactions"" report in Management Studio. This is found by right clicking on the AdventureWorks database, and the selecting Reports &gt; Standard Reports &gt; All Transactions. Expand the report sections by clicking the plus signs under ""State"", ""Session ID"", etc. Identify the details of the script's transactions in the database, making sure to specify <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>all</strong></span><strong> </strong>objects that are locked including the lock type and the lock mode for each resource that is locked. Use both screenshots <em>and </em>written text to explain what is locked and how. Be specific! Identify the session ID that is executing the transactions. Kill the process that left the transaction (and its locks) open. Document your work using screenshots and explain the process of killing an open transaction. Once you've killed the process, re-run the All Transactions report, showing that there are now no open transactions or lingering locks. Document this in your assignment submission.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">1) Log into your HW instance of SQL Server, it should have the AdventureWorks database on it. As you complete each step below, give specific cost values for each measurement you complete, either through screenshots or transcribing the cost values from the Actual Execution Plan in SQL Server.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">2) Write two queries. The first query will return a person's FirstName, MiddleName and LastName from the Person.Person table. The second query will return all of the items from the first query, plus AddressLine1, City, and PostalCode from the Person.Address table (which will have to be joined via the Person.BusinessEntityAddress table). Run each of the queries and measure their costs. Document the costs in a Word document with written explanations and screenshots, making comparisons specifically about how joins affect query cost.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">3) Write two more queries. The first should use JOINs to display a distinct list of the names of all customers in Person.Person whose address is in StateProvinceID 79.&nbsp; The second should do the same, only using subqueries instead of JOINs. (Hint: Use Person.Person, Person.BusinessEntityAddress and Person.Address). Run each of the queries and measure their costs. Document the costs in a Word document with written explanations and screenshots, making comparisons specifically about whether it is more cost efficient to use JOINs or subqueries.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">4) Using the Production.WorkOrder table, write a query to SUM the OrderQty and GROUP BY the ProductID. Measure the cost of the query. Add a HAVING clause (you can determine the criteria). Run the query again and examine the cost of using HAVING. Add a WHERE clause (you can determine the criteria again) and again examine the impact on cost. Add an ORDER BY clause and document the additional cost. Document in your Word document the final version of your query, with written explanation of the impacts on cost for each incremental addition to your query.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">5) Write a query to join Production.WorkOrder and Production.WorkOrderRouting. Add the resulting records into a single temp table. Compare the cost of running the the query that populates your temp table to the cost of populating and then selecting * from your temp table. Document your results, explaining the circumstances under which you would see use of a temp table as advantageous, based on <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">cost analysis of both creating and querying the temp table, versus just re-running the query multiple times</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">You should compare total costs. You are looking for the total cost of creating, populating and retrieving data from the temp table versus just repeatedly running the join query over and over again. The question you should answer is: at what point (number of query executions) is it more cost-effective to create a temp table and populate it, and then repeatedly select * from that table, than it would be to keep running the join query each time you need to retrieve that same data? Be clear about calculating and specifying the ""break even"" point for the cost of creating, populating, and using a temp table.</span></p>

Write a SQL statement that will copy the values from the Rate column into the new EncryptedRate column, ensuring that the Rate values will be converted into a unicode format and encrypted using the new a symmetric key. To demonstrate that your encryption worked, write a SELECT SQL statement that displays all table columns, including the decrypted values in the EncryptedRate column. Copy and paste all of your SQL code into your Word document as Step 1. Close the symmetric key when you are finished.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">2) Create a new asymmetric key that will do encryption by password. Write SQL that will add unicode data typed columns VacationHours2 and SickLeaveHours2 to the HumanResources.Employee table. Write SQL that will copy the Vacation and Sick Hours data in the Employee table into the new unicode columns, ensuring the values are converted to unicode and encrypted using the new asymmetric key. To demonstrate that your encryption worked, write a SELECT SQL statement that displays all table columns, including the decrypted values in the VacationHours2 and SickLeaveHours2 columns. Copy and paste all of your SQL code into your Word document as Step 2.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">3) Write SQL that will add a unicode data typed column called EmpPassword to the Person.EmailAddress table. Write SQL to set everyone's email password to be D4t4b&amp;se, in a hash+salt format. The salt will be the last six characters of each record's Rowguid, in reverse order. Add the reversed six characters to the beginning of the password, then hash the whole string. Write a SELECT SQL statement that will select all columns of the EmailAddress table except the EmpPassword column. Ensure that the WHERE clause is configured to successfully challenge the hash+salt passwords stored in EmpPass. Copy and paste all of your SQL code into your Word document as Step 3.</span></p>

<span><strong>Assignment Objectives:</strong></span><strong></strong>
</h3>
<p><span>You own a House Painting company of three people. &nbsp;In this assignment you will practice estimating the amount of work&nbsp;needed to complete the painting job for a new house project.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span><strong>Estimating in Scrum:</strong></span></h4>
<p>In Scrum, we estimate user stories to help determine how many user stories can be accomplished in our Sprint time frams.&nbsp; Over time a Scrum team will become better at knowing their velocity (how many user stories they can complete in a Sprint).</p>
<p>Scrum teams use different units to help them estimate: story points, T-shirt sizes, even Gummi Bears. We will use T-shirt size estimates (XS, S, M, L etc.) to help us estimate our House Painting Project because most of us have bought a T-shirt and understand this type of ordering. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The estimating process asks you to compare user stories against each other by level of difficulty or how hard or easy they will be for the team to complete.&nbsp; The very most basic/simple user story might be an XS, while the very most complex/hardest might be an XXL.&nbsp; In this House Painting Project, we are comparing different rooms in a house by their level of difficulty to paint.&nbsp; The most simple room to paint might be a hallway (XS) while the most complex might be a room like a kitchen that required lots of taking and care (XXL).&nbsp; How does a basic bedroom compare to a hallway or a kitchen?&nbsp; Probably somewhere in between these in difficulty.</p>
<p><span><strong>Work to be estimated:</strong></span></p>
<p>Painting each room will require each of these tasks:&nbsp;Room Prep (covering carpet and furniture, taping ceilings and baseboards, and removing outlet covers), painting the room, and room clean-up.</p>
<p>You will paint the following rooms:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Main Bathroom (10x8)</p>
<p>Main Bedroom (15x18) and on suite bathroom (10x12)</p>
<p>Kids Bathroom (8x8)</p>
<p>Bedroom 1 (10x14)</p>
<p>Bedroom 2 (12x13)</p>
<p>Kitchen (18x21)</p>
<p>Hallway (6x10)</p>
<p>Livingroom (20x16)</p>
<p>Two-car Garage (20x35)</p>
<p><span><strong>Create T-Shirt Estimate Labels</strong></span></p>
<p>For each room, estimate the amount of work needed to complete the task using the t-shirt labels:&nbsp;<strong>XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL.</strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,100.0,"['online_text_entry', 'online_upload']",1929556

<span><strong>Assignment Objectives:</strong></span><strong></strong>
</h3>
<p><span>You own a House Painting company of three people. &nbsp;In this assignment you will think through what it means for a room to be completely done.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span><strong>Definition of Done:</strong></span></h4>
<p>In Scrum, the definition of done is used as a checklist of all of the tasks that must be completed for work to be done. It is a tool to help all team members understand what it means for a task to be completed. In Scrum, ""done means done"". In other words, before a team member can say that a task is ""done"" all of the items in the checklist must be 100% completed. In part 1 of this assignment, you estimated how much effort would be required to complete each of the following rooms:</p>
<p>Main Bathroom (10x8)</p>
<p>Main Bedroom (15x18) and on suite bathroom (10x12)</p>

<p><span>In this assignment, your team will decide on a Definition of Done (DoD) that will help to ensure you are implementing your user stories with high quality.&nbsp; The DoD belongs to your whole team, so this is a team decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For this assignment, your team will make an initial attempt at identifying the steps or tasks needed to complete a generic user story,&nbsp; Think back to the House Painting Project where the DoD contained steps for completing the painting of a room with high quality. &nbsp;For your team DoD the major parts of implementing a user story might be: Design Checklist, Build Checklist, Integrate Checklist, and maybe a Test &amp; Document Checklist.&nbsp; &nbsp;As your team completes the tasks in each of the checklists you will have a user story that is ""Done"" and has been implemented with high quality.&nbsp; Think of the DoD as defining the ""full stack"" development of a user story that contains the front-end and back-end development.</span></p>
<p><span>So just what are the checklists you will need for your unique project.&nbsp; That is the purpose of this assignment.&nbsp; Your team will try to set these checklists as best you know at this point in the project.</span></p>
<p><span>Over time a team will fine-tune their DoD as part of the team's efforts at continuous improvement.</span></p>
<h3><span><strong>Instructions:</strong></span></h3>
<p>Create a&nbsp;definition of done document. Suggested areas for your checklist are:</p>
<p><span><strong>Design:</strong><br>Add tasks that might be needed to complete design of a user story.<br>Suggested tasks might include: <br>Design database elements and script database test data,<br>Mockup GUI following style guide<br>Pseodocode for server-side or JavaScript code<br>Test plans: Code test plan, security test plan, usability test plan etc.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Build:</strong><br>Add tasks that might be needed to code user story.<br>Suggested tasks might include:<br>Add needed database elements and test data<br>Code GUI following style guide<br>Write well-documented code<br>Unit Testing<br>Apply needed security measures</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Integrate:</strong><br>Add tasks that might be needed to integrate the feature with the system.<br>Suggested tasks might include:<br>Merge feature into system.<br>Update database script.<br>Test system for security issues<br>Usability testing</span></p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong><span><strong>:</strong><br>Add tasks that might be needed to document the feature with the system.<br>Suggested tasks might include:<br></span><span>Add training documentation<br>Add System Admin documentation</span></p>
<p><span>Your team should fine tune these steps to be acceptable to your team and client needs.<br>Depending on your system, development tools, and processes you may want to make changes to these checklists.&nbsp; After each sprint of development, the team will again have an opportunity to modify the DoD.<br></span></p>

<p>Before Sprint Planning begins take a few minutes and estimate the effort required to complete your user stories.&nbsp;Working with your team Product Owner, and looking at the highest priority of user stories on the Product Backlog, your team will set a Sprint Goal.&nbsp; This should be a short phrase to describe the overall goal of the Sprint.</p>
<p>Next, your team determines the number of user stories they think can be completed in the time-frame of the Sprint. These user stories are placed on the Sprint 1 Backlog.&nbsp; Then your team will add a Description and Acceptance Criteria to each user story card.</p>
<p>Next, generate a set of tasks associated with each of the user stories in the sprint backlog.</p>
<p>Lastly team members will sign up as owners of tasks related to the items in the Sprint Backlog.&nbsp; To do this team members should add a team member's initials or first name to each task in the backlog.&nbsp; When you sign up for a task, you are committing to the team that you will complete this task.&nbsp; More than one team member can sign up to work on a task.&nbsp; Do not sign up at the user story level but at a task level.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Best practice says that more than one person should work on a user story if you want it to have high quality.&nbsp; For example, the person who codes the user story should not conduct all the QA tests on the user story.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span><strong>Instructions:</strong></span></h3>
<p>Sprint 1 Planning should include the following steps:</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1.&nbsp; Set a sprint goal.</strong></span><br>The team and Product Owner should look at the top user stories in the Product Backlog and &nbsp;decide on a short phrase or sentence that might define an over-arching goal for Sprint 1.&nbsp; </p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2. &nbsp;Select the user stores for the sprint backlog.</strong></span><br>Edit each user story and provide a sentence or two <strong>Description</strong> and a list of <strong>Acceptance Criteria </strong>(steps team might use to demonstrate to the client that the story is completed) in the <strong>Description</strong> area of the card.&nbsp; Add any attachments or documents that will help describe the story.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 3. &nbsp;Determine the tasks associated with each backlog item and&nbsp;assign team members to each task.</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>For each backlog item determine the high-level tasks that must be completed to complete the item.</li>
<li>As a team, decided which of the tasks each team member will complete during the sprint. As you complete the sprint, you may decide to change these assignments.</li>
</ol>

<p>For this assignment you will reflect on the success of the sprint.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span><strong>Instructions:</strong></span></h3>
<p>The sprint review should include the following steps:</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1. &nbsp;Review the sprint goal.</strong></span><br>Review the goal you created for the sprint. In one or two sentences, reflect on the progress your team made toward accomplishing that goal.</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2. &nbsp;Review the completion of each sprint backlog&nbsp;item.</strong></span><br>List each sprint backlog item. If an item is ""done"" (meets your team's definition of done), note that it is done. If a task is not done, it will be placed back in the project backlog where it will be selected for completion in a future sprint. If the backlog items needs to be modified or split into multiple items, now is a good time to do that.</p>

<p>Before Sprint Planning begins take a few minutes and estimate the effort required to complete your user stories.&nbsp;Working with your team Product Owner, and looking at the highest priority of user stories on the Product Backlog, your team will set a Sprint Goal.&nbsp; This should be a short phrase to describe the overall goal of the Sprint.</p>
<p>Next, your team determines the number of user stories they think can be completed in the time-frame of the Sprint. These user stories are placed on the Sprint 2 Backlog.&nbsp; Then your team will add a Description and Acceptance Criteria to each user story card.</p>
<p>Next, generate a set of tasks associated with each of the user stories in the sprint backlog.</p>
<p>Lastly team members will sign up as owners of tasks related to the items in the Sprint Backlog.&nbsp; To do this team members should add a team member's initials or first name to each task in the backlog.&nbsp; When you sign up for a task, you are committing to the team that you will complete this task.&nbsp; More than one team member can sign up to work on a task.&nbsp; Do not sign up at the user story level but at a task level.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Best practice says that more than one person should work on a user story if you want it to have high quality.&nbsp; For example, the person who codes the user story should not conduct all the QA tests on the user story.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span><strong>Instructions:</strong></span></h3>
<p>Sprint 2 Planning should include the following steps:</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1.&nbsp; Set a sprint goal.</strong></span><br>The team and Product Owner should look at the top user stories in the Product Backlog and &nbsp;decide on a short phrase or sentence that might define an over-arching goal for Sprint 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2. &nbsp;Select the user stores for the sprint backlog.</strong></span><br>Edit each user story and provide a sentence or two <strong>Description</strong> and a list of <strong>Acceptance Criteria </strong>(steps team might use to demonstrate to the client that the story is completed) in the <strong>Description</strong> area of the card.&nbsp; Add any attachments or documents that will help describe the story.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 3. &nbsp;Determine the tasks associated with each backlog item and&nbsp;assign team members to each task.</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>For each backlog item determine the high-level tasks that must be completed to complete the item.</li>
<li>As a team, decided which of the tasks each team member will complete during the sprint. As you complete the sprint, you may decide to change these assignments.</li>

<p>1 - your team completed (or even worked on) all of the items in the sprint backlog.</p>

<p>Throughout the class you will be using the VMs quite a lot, to make them easier to identify I have created a couple of graphics that you can use as the desktop wallpaper to make the VMs a bit easier to identify.&nbsp; You will download the images and set them as your wallpaper.</p>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>From your, Debian-1 VM open the web browser (probably firefox). After you double-click on the desktop icon just wait, you probably won’t see an hourglass or indicator that it is starting, just be patient.&nbsp; If it doesn’t start after a couple of minutes try again. [If you are still having problems make sure that they are on the NAT adapter and click on the WICD to disconnect and reconnect--you might also try rebooting the machine]</li>
<li>You should have an internet connection if all went well.</li>
<li>Enter is.gd/IT2600 or go to canvas and your login credentials navigate to IT2600&gt;files&gt;T01 History and VMs&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Right-click</strong> on the appropriate file <strong>png</strong> and select<strong> download</strong> or <strong>save</strong> <strong>link as&nbsp;</strong>depending on your version of browser</li>
<li>Accept the default location and filename click<strong> Save</strong>.</li>
<li>Now set the image as your desktop wallpaper.
<ol>
<li>
<strong>right-click</strong> on your VMs desktop</li>
<li>Select Desktop <strong>Preferences</strong>
</li>
<li>Click on the little folder by the wallpaper name</li>
<li>Navigate to <strong>root/downloads</strong> then select <strong>png<br></strong>
</li>
<li>Click <strong>Open</strong>
</li>
<li>Now click <strong>Close</strong> to close the desktop preferences dialog</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Repeat this procedure for <strong>Debian 2 and 3</strong> using the appropriate images.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Screen captures showing the desktop images and upload the file here.&nbsp;</h2>
<p>word format is probably the easiest. Just paste the 3 in a .docx file.&nbsp; Should look something like this</p>
<p><img src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/534838/files/109751746/preview?verifier=ZgqxeBzBVUFjVIMZN8KgLbZRF3wZLOPLJSCKS1Gp"" alt=""Debian Colored backgrounds"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/534838/files/109751746"" data-api-returntype=""File""> &nbsp;</p>
<h1>Wrap-up</h1>
<p>Close your virtual machines.&nbsp; You can either shut down the VMs with the power button on the desktop or suspend the VMs state.</p>

<p>As your network is currently configured, if Debian-1 sends data to a device on the 192.168.2.0 or 192.168.3.0 networks it sends the data to its default gateway (the pfsense box) then pfsense forwards it to Router-1, which means that the traffic destined for those two networks will cross the 192.168.1.0 network twice.&nbsp; What would you have to do to prevent this inefficiency?&nbsp; Please give me a word document or pdf.</p>
<p>Current configuration routing causes the video files stored on Debian1 to travel to Debian 3 network like so:</p>
<p>Debian1<span style=""background-color: #fbeeb8;"">-&gt;pfsense-&gt;router1-&gt;</span>router2-&gt;Debian3</p>
<p>Here is what the traceroute could change to be current is the first one and desired is the second one:</p>
<p><img id=""110642460"" src=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/534838/files/110642460/preview?verifier=Bf29EAkCDqx7A9a94tUhpgmsHlYW0m2IRR4sgJtt"" alt=""IT2600 TraceRoute Speed Increase.png"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/534838/files/110642460"" data-api-returntype=""File""></p>
<p>Since rewiring is very expensive and time-consuming is there something that can be done in software to remedy having it repeated twice (Debian1 and Pfsense sending the same message on the same LAN)</p>
<p>If you are still having problems figuring out how routing works look at the <a href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/534838/files/109751925/download?verifier=MgOYyBZuTjURe8Bm6qMulsuzYCkBtK99FvUJdf6U"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/534838/files/109751925"" data-api-returntype=""File"">IT2600 Lab Routing Explanation Document </a>found in the files section of the course to make sure you understand what is happening with the routing.&nbsp; This document shows the routing from Debian3 out....think it through what happens with the Routing as Debian 1 tries to talk with Debian2 or Debian3.</p>
<p>I am not asking you to go to the expense of rewiring the network. &nbsp;Physically you have to get the wires through. &nbsp;For example, pfsense is located where the ISP enters the building in the basement networking closet. &nbsp;Debian1 is the network on the first floor and Debian2 is on the network on the second. &nbsp;Router 2 is a WAP located on the third floor. &nbsp;Debian3 is a network of laptops used by executives. &nbsp; It would require rewiring and a lot of expense to hook up the WAP on the 3rd floor directly to Pfsense down the basement. &nbsp;It is much easier/cost-effective to wire it to the 2nd floor router.</p>
<p>I am looking for a software solution using something that you have learned in this lab.&nbsp; I have highlighted the routing I would like you to be able to change.&nbsp; What commands have you learned to work with routing is other tasks in this lab?</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,5.0,"['online_text_entry', 'online_upload']",1929556

To select a topic, start in an area you know very well and find out what has just happened or what is about to happen.&nbsp; For example, if I know about IPv6&nbsp; but I do not know about network cabling then I should pick a topic such as the conversion to IPv6&nbsp; to share rather than new innovations to IEEE standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may use slides, powerpoints, short video clips, anything you can make work in front of the class--such as writing on the whiteboard or bringing in equipment or a picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In your five-minute presentation you should use the following language (where <em>X</em> is your topic):</p>
<p>“<em>X</em> is important because…”</p>
<p>“What I learned about <em>X</em> is…”</p>
<p>“Some other topics that are related to <em>X</em> are…”</p>
<p>""In the last month this is what has happened with X....""&nbsp; use a news source to answer this question</p>
<p>""People who understand X have ... jobs and make ... salary""&nbsp; use indeed.com or similar site to answer this question</p>
<p>After completing this assignment the student should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>recognize important current topics in networking</li>
<li>gather and organize information</li>
<li>present information to colleagues</li>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Download (or create) a Windows VM for use this semester in completing your lab assignments.&nbsp; I recommend using VirtualBox. You may use VMWare if you prefer, but you will need the full VMWare Workstation (not just the player) to complete the assignments.
<ul>
<li>This VM should run Windows 10 with MSEdge browser.</li>
<li>You may download this VM from <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/"" target=""_blank"">Microsoft Edge Developer: Virtual Machines</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Hands-On Project 13-4 from the book. (ALWAYS Hands-On Project, NEVER Case Project!)</p>
<p>Deliverables for Book Lab assignments include a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>written description of what you did</strong>, what you learned in the experience (especially if you had to vary from the published directions),<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>and screenshots</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>of any responses or reports generated.&nbsp; If the report is long, you do NOT need to include the whole thing, just a representative part of at the start will be fine. (You may take a screenshot of the active window in Windows by pressing Alt-Printscreen.)&nbsp; The image can then be pasted in your word processor and saved.&nbsp; I am not looking for a travel log here (Don't say 'I clicked this, I saw this, here’s a photo'.) I am specifically looking for you to tell me what assignments were things you had not known about or done before, your reactions to the lab, and what value or applicability you find in the exercise.</p>

Feel free to agree or disagree with others, raise objections, ask questions of them, etc., but please do so with respect. Please also use supporting documentation and research to support statements and claims where appropriate. And while we always want to be cordial in our class communications, let’s avoid posting simple messages such as “yes,” “I agree,” or “thank you.” This will keep the forum less cluttered and ensure that viewed responses are substantive.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Communicating in a Professional Manner:</strong></p><p>A posting to a discussion forum constitutes formal written communication. As such, postings should follow the conventions of the English language. Proper grammar should be used and postings should be checked for spelling. It is recommended that you proofread your postings before they are submitted to the forum.</p></div></div><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,10.0,['discussion_topic'],1929556

C. (1992).&nbsp; Instructional design and the development of statistical literacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Teaching Sociology, 20,</em>&nbsp;143-149.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above article is an argument for the best way to teach statistics to sociology students.&nbsp; Let’s discuss if some of their tenets apply to the business world as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bessant claims that once students are in the workplace “the final analysis statistics courses are less important to students than basic reasoning skills and commonsense analysis… [S]tatistical procedures themselves are based on reason and assist us in refining [our] thinking” (p. 148-149). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(1)&nbsp;</strong>Briefly&nbsp;<strong>(2-3 sentences)</strong>&nbsp;respond to the following:&nbsp; Do you agree?&nbsp; Do you think that&nbsp;<u>basic reasoning skills and commonsense</u>&nbsp;are more important than&nbsp;<u>skilled statistical analysis</u>?&nbsp; Do you think that you can have a full understanding of one without some understanding of the other?&nbsp; <strong>Why or why not?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bessant further argues that the best way to teach these basic reasoning skills and commonsense analysis is “through very simple discussions of&nbsp;<em>when</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;certain statistics are to be employed in research or occupational settings” (p. 148).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This does not mean that all [businesspersons] must become empiricists to serve their [organization]; rather we must understand statistical processes to defend… against the misuse of quantitative analysis. &nbsp;Statistics students should be obliged to acquire a working knowledge of such procedures and how they can be applied to help support or disqualify one's own and others' contentions about…reality” (p. 149, edited to adjust for a business organization paradigm, rather than sociological).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this argument in mind, you will create a scenario in a fictitious workplace in which a statistical analysis could be used inappropriately.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>a statistical analysis that might include explicit or implicit biases,</li>
<li>a statistical analysis is used to penalize coworkers or employees unjustly,</li>
<li>a statistical analysis is used to construct unrealistic goals for the organization, or</li>
<li>a statistical analysis is supports current structures of inequality.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Briefly&nbsp;(2-3 sentences)&nbsp;describe</strong> the fictitious workplace and the research that was performed (this does not need to include any of the specific statistical analyses, just include important elements such as the population or sample that was studied, the fictitious findings of the research, or anything that helps you to explain why the research was used inappropriately.)&nbsp; I really do want this part to be brief – I want the focus of your reflection to be on the positivity of the third (3) prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong>&nbsp;Then <strong>discuss</strong> at least one way in which that same statistical analysis might be used to improve the employee experience or move the workplace culture in a positive direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>This should be the bulk of your reflection</strong>&nbsp;and is what we will discussed in class. Be creative!&nbsp; Be as idealistic as you want to be!&nbsp; If you feel like your reflection sounds cheesy - you're on the right track!</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,10.0,['online_text_entry'],1929556

<p><span><strong>Corporate Social Responsibility</strong></span></p>
<p>Let’s discuss Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; Is it important?&nbsp; Why or why not?&nbsp; What does this have to do with stats?</p>
<p>Here’s an article to cover the basics of CSR.</p>
<p><a class=""inline_disabled external"" href=""https://www.newsweek.com/2019/11/29/corporate-social-responsibility-good-bad-1473934.html"" target=""_blank""><span>https://www.newsweek.com/2019/11/29/corporate-social-responsibility-good-bad-1473934.html</span><span class=""screenreader-only"">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a></p>
<p>There are plenty of other things to read on the web about corporate social responsibility.&nbsp; Read as much or as little as you want, just make sure you are prepared to have a discussion on the topic.</p>
<p>So, how does statistics relate to CSR?</p>
<p>And the real question:&nbsp; How can statistics improve CSR?&nbsp; This is what you will discuss in your Reflection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t want to put too many limits on your initial post, but here are some questions to get you started:</p>
<p><strong>(300 word minimum)</strong></p>
<p>Is CSR important?&nbsp; Why or why not?</p>
<p>How could CSR be implemented in your future profession?</p>
<p>How could statistics be used to improve the culture of CSR?</p>
<p>Describe a specific example (real or fiction) of using business statistics to contribute to CSR.&nbsp;</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,10.0,['online_text_entry'],1929556

<p><strong><u>Description of Project</u></strong></p>
<p>For this project, you will write a brief report on presidential approval rating trends for the first year in office.</p>
<p>You will find two 90% confidence intervals for the approval rating of each of the past four presidents, one when they first took office, and one for November of their first year in office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to <a href=""https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president-biden-job-approval-7320.html"">https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president-biden-job-approval-7320.html</a> and find the approval rating for when the President Biden first assumed office in 2021. (Hover your cursor over the line chart.) Construct the 90% confidence interval for the approval rating assuming that the sample size is 600 randomly chosen American citizens. Next find an approval rating for President Biden from November 2021 and construct another confidence interval for the approval rating using a sample size of 600. Comment on the changes between the intervals and provide possible causes for the changes, citing at least one source per president. Repeat this process with Trump, Obama, and Bush, finding an approval rating from when they first took office and then again from November of their first year in office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Overall Design of Report</u></strong></p>
<p>The overall design of your report should be professional, organized, thorough, and visually easy to follow. Your final report should be submitted into Canvas in a Word document (it does not need to be limited to 1 page). Feel free to use text boxes, shapes, flow charts, graphics, etc. to make your report have a professional appearance and well organized. You do not need to go overboard with the look of the report – it’s the content that matters most. Below are the five sections that must be included in your report (Research Design, Statistical Results, Discussion, Conclusion, References – you do not have to use these exact titles for your sections as long as each is clearly represented) along with the specific content needed in each section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The entire report (other than the Statistical Results section) must be in complete sentences. </em></p>
<p><em>Please proofread your writing to ensure professional quality.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong><u>Sources</u></strong></p>
<p>You will need to find some resources to back up your reasonings, justifications, and conclusions. I anticipate that most sources will be news articles, so make sure they come from a reputable journalistic organization. I’m not concerned about how you format your citations or references list, just be consistent. Include in-text citations and if you directly quote from a source, be sure to use quotation marks. You will also create a References section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Research Design (20 points)</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong> </strong>What is the population being studied? What is the sample? <strong>(4 points)</strong></li>
<li><strong> </strong>Are these sampling distributions of sample means or sample proportions? <strong>(4 points)</strong></li>
<li><strong> </strong>Can we assume that the sampling distribution is normally distributed? Why or why not? <strong>(6 points)</strong></li>
<li><strong> </strong>When finding these confidence intervals, will you use the critical z-score or critical t-score? Explain why one is used in this case and the other is not. <strong>(6 points)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Statistical Results (20 points)</u></strong></p>
<p>This is the <em>only</em> section that does not need complete sentences. Please report each the following information for each confidence interval in a clear and organized manner such as a list or table. <strong>(2.5 points per CI)</strong></p>
<p>President Name Initial/November Approval Rating</p>
<p>90% CI [lower bound, upper bound]</p>
<p>n = 600</p>
<p>p̅ = sample approval rating</p>
<p>sample date</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Discussion (30 points) </u></strong></p>
<p>For each of the past four presidents (Biden, Trump, Obama, and Bush) include the following in your report.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> </strong>Confidence intervals (restated from the Statistical Results section, but in sentence form) and findings including the sample approval rating and sample date for both the initial and November approval rating. <strong>(12 points)</strong></li>
<li><strong> </strong>Describe the change in confidence intervals – did the approval rating increase, decrease, or remain about the same? Discuss whether the confidence intervals overlap and how this affects your analysis. <strong>(6 points)</strong></li>
<li><strong> </strong>Discuss a possible cause, or causes, for the increase, decrease, or stagnation of the approval rating. This will require some speculation but cite at least one source as a basis for your reasoning. Be sure to use quotation marks for any direct quotes. <strong>(12 points)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion (20 points)</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong> </strong>Is there a general trend for approval ratings for the first year in office of a president? Did all four of these presidents’ approval rating in this report behave the same way? <strong>(10 points)</strong></li>
<li><strong> </strong>What are some circumstances that might cause a president’s approval rating to go against this trend? <strong>(10 points)</strong></li>
<li><strong> </strong>Include 1-2 sources to back up your conclusions about presidential approval ratings. Be sure to use quotation marks for any direct quotes.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>References (10 points)</u></strong></p>
<p>Include a works cited page with the necessary details of your sources. You can use whatever format you choose for your references, just be consistent and organized. Please include authors, dates, titles, organizations, and any URLs. I should be able to find your sources easily from your references list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Final Submission (2 documents)</u></strong></p>
<p>Please submit your Word document with your completed report and the R HTML document to show your work creating the confidence intervals.</p>

<p><strong>Take the Unit 1 Exam here.</strong></p>
<p>You will need to set up Proctorio for this exam. Review the UVU Proctorio instructions if you need to.&nbsp;If the exam requires a password, it means that you need to update Proctorio or Google Chrome.</p>
<p>Proctorio settings will allow you to move between programs (R, Connect, Canvas, Word, Excel, etc.). The exam is open book, open note, open R, Word, Excel, etc.&nbsp; It is not open website or neighbor.</p>

<p><strong>Tips for taking this in Canvas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pay close attention to rounding instructions. For example, if instructions say to round to 4 decimal places and your answer is 4, you should enter 4.0000 into Canvas. You should also include leading zeros. If your answer is .9 you should enter 0.9 into Canvas.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do not include dollar signs ($) or commas (,) in your numerical responses.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Some of the data files in the exam will have the same names as homework data files. They are not the same! Make sure to use the data provided in this exam for your analyses.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you complete the exam, you will not be able to see your score yet. There are some questions that must be manually graded. Be patient and the instructor will update your overall grade soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Good luck!</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Create a team ePortfolio using Google Sites.</li>
<li>Create a team charter and put it on the home page of your Google Sites website.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will add to this team ePortfolio throughout the course.</p>
<h4><strong>Google Sites ePortfolio Set Up</strong></h4>
<p>The platform you will use for your blogs is Google Sites. Review the <a class=""external"" href=""https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/sites/get-started/#!/"" target=""_blank""><span>tutorial</span><span class=""screenreader-only"">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a> or the&nbsp;<a class=""external"" href=""https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/sites/cheat-sheet/#!/"" target=""_blank""><span>cheat sheet </span><span class=""screenreader-only"">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a>or jump right in by logging into your Google account with your UVU gmail, going&nbsp; to Google Drive, and clicking on ""+ New,"" and ""Google Sites."" One person on your team needs to create the website and give editing rights to the other team members. Anyone on your team can do this - just take the initiative. (The tutorial explains the options for sharing).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use your UVU gmail accounts - UVUID@my.uvu.edu so that each team member can access the site and edit the pages. Please also share your site with me at 10008795@my.uvu.edu. <strong>(I don't need editing privileges)</strong>. You also need to share the site publicly in order for other teams to review it. A major advantage of Google sites is that you will be able to work on your page at the same time as other members of your team and see by name who is working on what in the same way you do with Google docs.</p>
<p>To view who is on your team, go to People in the left-hand menu bar of Canvas, and click on Groups. You will see all the teams and team members listed.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Home Page - Team Charter</strong></h4>

<p>For your first assignment, create a home page for your consulting team and include an About Us section. Coordinate with each other on what you need to do for this assignment, your roles, and who is responsible for what. In essence, you are&nbsp; are creating a team charter to guide your team's processes throughout the semester. Communicate your ideas using text, graphics, images, and multimedia. Provide the following information.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vision and mission -&nbsp;</em></strong>What do you want to achieve as a team in terms of learning about organizational behavior theories, how to use them, and how to share your expertise with others?</p>
<p><strong><em>Roles</em></strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;What are your team roles and responsibilities? See ideas below. You can create your own roles and your own names for roles. You can also rotate roles to benefit from each other’s skills or develop new skills.</p>
<p><strong>CEO </strong>– the team leader determines what needs to be done, directs the work, and keeps the team on track. The leader collaborates with team members to plan and organize tasks, distribute tasks, and ensure work is done on time and done well. The leader makes decisions in collaboration with the team, is responsible for communicating, addresses problems, and helps motivate team members. The leader facilitates teamwork.</p>
<p><strong>Content Contributors </strong>– content contributors identify possible topics and scenarios for the team to consider. They generate discussion around ideas and push the team’s thinking in original and creative ways. Different types of content contributors are possible such as a <em>resource contributor</em> who identifies possible topics and scenarios and needed sources of information; an <em>ideas contributor</em> who suggests ways to solve problems, new methods for accomplishing tasks, or creative ways to present information; an <em>analysis contributor</em> who engages team members in critical analysis of ideas to consider them more carefully and make them stronger; this person ensures that all possibilities have been considered and the team’s ideas are solid and well thought out.</p>
<p><strong>Specialists</strong> – specialists oversee areas such as <em>synthesizing</em> the content, <em>editing and proofreading</em>, <em>page design</em>, and <em>multimedia selection. </em>You could also have an <em>evaluator</em> responsible for generating discussion around ways in which the team needs to improve or a <em>troubleshooter </em>to focus on technical or even people issues.</p>
<p><strong><em>Organizational culture. </em></strong>Determine what you want your organization (e.g., team) to look like—organizational culture is the underlying rules in an organization or how things get done. What behaviors do you expect of each other in terms of communication, contributions, responsibilities, completion of work, decision-making, discussion, and feedback? How will you work out personality differences and resolve problems?</p>
<p><strong><em>Communication and contact</em></strong>. What is the best way each team member can be contacted? What tools will you use to collaborate and communicate—Google drive &amp; docs; <a class=""instructure_file_link inline_disabled"" href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software"" target=""_blank"">MS Teams</a>,&nbsp;<a class=""external"" href=""https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9282720#tips"" target=""_blank""><span>Google Meet</span></a><a class=""external"" href=""https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9282720#tips"" target=""_blank""><span class=""screenreader-only"" style=""display: inline !important;"">&nbsp;(Links to an external site</span></a>, or <a class=""external"" href=""https://operative.zoom.us/"" target=""_blank""><span>Zoom</span><span class=""screenreader-only"">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a> for virtual team meetings (see suggestions in the <a title=""Effective Teams "" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/560059/discussion_topics/3232850"" target=""_blank"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/560059/discussion_topics/3232850"" data-api-returntype=""Discussion"">Meet Your Team</a> assignment)? What are your meeting dates and times? The better your plan and organize, the more successful you will be.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Submission</strong></span></h4>
<p>When you complete your page, you need to publish it.</p>

<p>Only one person on your team needs to submit the URL.

There are <strong>four parts </strong>to this assignment (see below). Continue to post and respond to posts throughout the week to make sure you have connected with everyone on your team and have established clear methods of communication.</p><ol><li><strong>Share an image of something that represents you - explain why. </strong>See <a href=""https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10700-4212190965"">how to embed an image in this discussion</a>.</li><li><strong>Review the information about effective teams that follows.</strong> Post a short paragraph about how you can apply this information to work effectively as a team. Focus specifically on the principles and theories mentioned, not just your own opinion. Here are couple of good examples:<p><em>I believe that norms in a group are important for success like the video talks about. These informal rules will really help us know our roles and take a step back when we need to. &nbsp;Sometimes different people will be the leader different times, and we can adapt and follow. I believe that conflict is important because it can be positive if it makes something better. Resolving conflict in a mature and factual way will really help us when we do have disagreements or opposing views.</em></p><p><em>After watching the video, some of the things that I learned was that forming a charter is a great way to establish ground rules to help the team later on in the process. It talks about student project groups fall in to punctuated equilibrium, which means initially focused but end up waiting until the deadline to rush and get things done. In order to avoid that we as a group should stick to the team formation cycle of forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. A final interesting point in the video that I liked was when it talks about the performing stage where the productivity is at its best and every has a good feel for how everyone else works.</em></p></li><li><strong>Set up communication and collaboration methods for your team assignments.</strong> Hold your first weekly team meeting (more information on this assignment is on the next page in the module) to get a system in place so that you can complete your first team assignment -<a class=""instructure_file_link inline_disabled"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/560059/assignments/6292117"" target=""_blank"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/560059/assignments/6292117"" data-api-returntype=""Assignment"">Team ePortfolio &amp; Charter</a> &nbsp;Schedule your weekly virtual team meetings.

Personality differences between two team members are quite different than disagreement about how to complete an assignment or project.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever the difference, it is helpful to frame the resolution in terms of being an effective and successful team. For example, how can our differences make our project better?&nbsp; How can we best complete the project?&nbsp; Remember that team work takes cooperation, which means compromise. Use differences to make your team and your work even stronger.&nbsp;</p><p>The first step is to specifically identify the nature or source of the conflict. The next step is dialogue, to talk through the problem. If two people are having personality differences, they should first try to work it among themselves, followed by meeting with another team member or the whole team.</p><p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Characteristics of High-Performance Teams&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li>Common Purpose - a shared vision of the team's mission</li><li>Common Performance Goals - clear and consistent performance goals</li><li>Common Working Approach - issues related to work ethic, norms, roles, etc.</li><li>Mutual Accountability - willing to sacrifice personal interests for the team's goals and trust in team members</li><li>Complementary Skills - right skills mix to accomplish the goals</li><li>Small Size - the least important of the 6 factors, but 4-10 people is usually ideal</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Stages of Team Formation</span></p><div class=""entry-content""><div class=""discussion-section message_wrapper""><div class=""message user_content enhanced"" data-bind=""message""><p class=""page-title""><a class="""" href=""https://youtu.be/DZbmIg0c2s4""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Stages of Team Formation&nbsp;</span></a></p></div></div></div><div class=""entry-content""><div class=""discussion-section message_wrapper""><div class=""message user_content enhanced"" data-bind=""message""><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,10.0,['discussion_topic'],1929556

Your goal is to provide recommendations to your client about how to solve an organizational behavior problem that the company is experiencing (e.g., motivation, job satisfaction, conflict, change), and most importantly, why your recommendations will work based on the theories and concepts you are learning. Be sure to consider current issues such as those related to COVID-19, diversity and inclusion, or to ethical issues.</p>
<p>For this assignment, you will submit a proposal for your project. <span style=""background-color: #bfedd2;""><strong>Complete Steps 1 and 2 ONLY</strong></span>. Review these <a title=""Project Proposal Examples"" href=""https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/560059/pages/project-proposal-examples"" data-api-endpoint=""https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/560059/pages/project-proposal-examples"" data-api-returntype=""Page"">Project Proposal Examples.</a></p>
<h4>Project Steps</h4>
<p>Step 1</p>
<p>Identify a company and get permission to do the project.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">The company you consult with can be a family business, a business where you or one of your team members works now or a business where you or a team member has worked in the past, a business where a family member works, or any company where you have a connection. Talk to the owner or manager, explain the assignment, identify a ""people"" issue the company is experiencing, and get permission to do the project. Work with the owner/manager throughout the project and provide regular updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2&nbsp;</p>
<p>Submit a proposal for approval by your instructor.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Create a blog post in your ePortfolio website for the proposal. One person on the team needs to submit the URL to your page. Include the following information.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #000000;"">Background information about the organization (size, purpose, location, number of employees, etc.).</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #000000;"">A general description of the problem (through your contact at the organization and your own experience if applicable). Provide enough detail for me to determine that the problem is related to organizational behavior.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #000000;"">Your ideas for data collection (e.g., interviews, focus groups, observations, surveys) to identify the cause of the problem and possible solutions.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #000000;"">A proposed timeline with steps and due dates. Steps might include reviewing theories, preparing interview questions, conducting interviews, analyzing data, drafting content, designing the blog page, etc. Refer to the due dates for various aspects of the project.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #000000;"">How you will delegate tasks to team members - who will be doing what. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The proposal will be tentative and things may change. Think about what needs to be done to have a successful project. See the rubric for how you will be graded on the proposal.</span></p>
<p>Step 3</p>
<p>Receive approval from your instructor to proceed. After you receive approval, complete the remaining steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 4</p>
<p>Gain an understanding of the problem by talking to people, observing, interviewing, conducting focus groups, examining documents, or conducting surveys. This can be done virtually. Get perspectives on the problem from a range of different people and enough people that you can identify what is happening and why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 5</p>
<p>Consider different theories you have studied and find one that is most applicable to resolving the key issues. Identify 2-3 specific recommendations based on the theory. Explain why these recommendations will work. To do this, you will need to help your client understand the theory on which the recommendations are based.</p>
<p>Step 6</p>
<p>Present your final report as a blog post on your website ePortfolio. Please note that there are a variety of ways to organize and present the information.

<p><strong>Remember that your goal is to provide recommendations to your client about how to solve an organizational behavior problem and explain why your recommendations will work based on the theories you are learning.</strong></p>
<p>To do this, you will need to:</p>

<li>Show that you understand the company and its purpose (e.g., provide background information about the company and its mission/goals). You can use the same information you created for your project proposal - just update it as needed.</li>
<li>Explain the problem, what you did to understand it better (e.g., interviews, observations, documents, surveys), and your findings.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Make 2-3 recommendations and explain why they will work. To do this, you will need to help your client understand the theory that supports the recommendations. Make your recommendations specific enough that your client can easily implement them.</li>

<li>Data &amp; analysis - describe the data you have collected (observations, interviews, surveys, documents, etc.), plans for further data collection, and what you have learned so far.</li>
<li>Theory - suggest one or two organizational behavior theories that may be relevant. Refer to specific theories (e.g., Herzberg's Two Factor Theory, McClellan's Needs Theory, transformational leadership) rather than topics (e.g., motivation, leadership, communication).</li>
<li>Recommendations - explain how you think the theory applies and how it might lead to specific recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the ePortfolio format to its advantage; rather than dense amounts of text, use bullet points, graphics, tables, pictures, and other design elements to effectively convey the information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Include as much information as you have. If some parts are still in progress, please indicate this.</strong></p>

He is a seasoned pulmonologist who has a lot of experience and background in organizational behavior from a very practical perspective as he has worked here in Utah. He has done this in my course before and has some fascinating insights to share, but he would prefer to also answer any questions you may have as a part of this discussion. <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""https://www.loom.com/share/63d40665c8d940b5b530f30726dcacf8"" target=""_blank"">Here is a previous video I shared</a> to introduce Dr. Bishop and to give you some ideas on the kinds of questions you might want to ask him.

<p><span>For this extra credit submission, you will be required to write or record a reflection on Dr. Bishop's presentation, commenting directly to him, if you would like. In your reflection:&nbsp;<strong>1)</strong>&nbsp;highlight three distinct things you learned from his presentation,<strong>&nbsp;2)&nbsp;</strong>describe why they were impactful for you and&nbsp;<strong>3)&nbsp;</strong>explain how you would like to apply this in your own life/sphere(s) of influence.&nbsp;</span></p>

Over the course of the forum, please read the postings of other students and pose at least two additional thoughts, comments, or questions to fellow students. Participants should, of course, respond to classmates’ comments and questions directed specifically to them.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>What is a “Substantive” Response?</strong></p><p>Substantive responses to most discussion questions should require a paragraph or two sometimes more—not simply a “yes,” “no” or one sentence answer. Feel free to agree or disagree with others, raise objections, ask questions of them, etc., but please do so with respect. Please also use supporting documentation and research to support statements and claims where appropriate. And while we always want to be cordial in our class communications, let’s avoid posting simple messages such as “yes,” “I agree,” or “thank you.” This will keep the forum less cluttered and ensure that viewed responses are substantive.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Communicating in a Professional Manner:</strong></p><p>A posting to a discussion forum constitutes formal written communication. As such, postings should follow the conventions of the English language. Proper grammar should be used and postings should be checked for spelling.

<p>According to United Nations estimates, more than half of the world population live in just seven countries, with China, closely followed by India, leading the pack. The other five countries on the list include the United States, Indonesia, Pakistan, Brazil, and Nigeria. It is believed that India will overtake China to become the world’s most populous nation much sooner than previously thought (<em>CNN, June 2019</em>). For this project, you will collect population data (in millions) from the World Bank for India and China from 1960 to 2021. You will use the sample information to explore linear and nonlinear trend regression models to capture the population trend for both China and India. You will then use the preferred model(s) to forecast the populations of China and India.</p>

<ul>
<li><span>Recognize which types of messages are categorized as good news/routine messages.</span></li>
<li><span>Evaluate the best approaches, and create appropriate, effective workplace communication (professional communication).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Knowledge. </strong></span><span>By writing a routine message, you will improve your skills in providing useable information in written form. This assignment will help you become familiar with the following content knowledge in this discipline:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>GDP message format.</span></li>

<p><span><strong>Task</strong>.&nbsp;</span><span>Create a company-wide email as the task force chairperson for your company’s Safe-Return-to-the-Office Task Force. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #236fa1;""><strong>Writing Prompt. Return to Work*&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #236fa1;"">You are letting employees know that the company is considering a few different return-to-work models and that employees’ input is required and highly sought-after. You need to inform all employees that they need to complete a lengthy survey about their experiences working from home over the past year.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #236fa1;"">The survey will ask about how they completed their work remotely and their feelings about working remotely. The survey will take about two hours to complete, and they are to complete it during normal working hours.

<p><span style=""color: #236fa1;"">In your writing, show respect to valued employees by requesting action rather than demanding obedience. Show sensitivity to employees who have widely varying opinions about safety and workplace productivity.</span></p>
<p><strong>Criteria for Success. </strong><span>Your writing will be evaluated according to the COS rubric. Remember to follow the recommended outline: Good news (main idea), Details, and Positive closing. Use the goodwill principles you have learned. Edit for punctuation and grammar.</span></p>
<p><span>This assignment is worth 100 points and will be computed within the Writing Assignments category of classwork.</span></p>
<p><span>*This writing prompt, as with others you will encounter in this class, is <i>poorly written</i> and <i>incomplete</i>. While writing prompts incorporate good punctuation and grammar, they are purposely written with poor you attitude, negative words, and questionable tone. That’s why you shouldn’t use the wording from the prompt. Your job is to use the <i>information</i> you’ve been given but to use your own words to respond to the prompt and to add any information that will help complete your message and convince your reader of your good intentions.&nbsp;</span></p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,100.0,['external_tool'],1929556

Delivering indirect bad news in a way that maintains goodwill is a common business task you’ll encounter in your career. The goal of a bad-news message is for the reader to read, understand, and accept the bad news. The readers should feel if they were in your shoes, they would have made the same decision.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Skills</strong><span>. You will write an indirect, bad-news message using the recommended outline, NEMO or BBBB. By writing well-considered bad-news messages, you will maintain the loyalty and respect of your employees and clients. This employee and client satisfaction can build goodwill and also positively impact your company’s bottom line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Knowledge</strong><span>. By writing an indirect bad-news message, you will know how to deliver bad news in a way that maintains goodwill.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #236fa1;""><strong>Writing Prompt: Double-booked Wedding Day</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #236fa1;"">You work as an event planner for Florence Events Center, a beautiful venue that hosts weddings, family reunions, corporate meetings, parties, etc. The venue consists of a grand hall that can accommodate over 200 people as well as a beautiful garden area that is more fitting for smaller groups. To reserve either space, the client pays a $1,500 non-refundable deposit upon booking.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #236fa1;"">While looking over the schedule for the next few months, you notice that the grand hall has accidentally been double-booked for two wedding ceremonies on July 17, 2022. You pull up the transaction record and notice that the accidental booking was made two weeks ago by a new front desk employee during his first day on the job. The new employee collected the $1,500 deposit from the unlucky bride-to-be, Ms. Olivia DeLeon, and promised her the grand hall for her ceremony. The notes indicate that the ceremony would include about 25 guests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #236fa1;"">Of course, you must email Ms. DeLeon immediately to let her know that you cannot honor the terms of her original booking because of the mistake. You understand how difficult this news might be for Ms. DeLeon to hear and want to be mindful of her feelings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #236fa1;""><strong>Task: Write an indirect, bad-news email to Ms. Olivia DeLeon, letting her know about the double-booking and that you cannot honor her original request. However, what are some alternatives you could suggest to help remedy the situation and maintain goodwill?&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Criteria for success</strong><span>. As always, your writing will be evaluated according to the COS Rubric. Remember to follow the recommended outline (Neutral beginning, Explanation, Main idea [bad news], Original/positive ending </span><span>OR Bond, Bridge, Bad-news, Build</span><span>). Use the building goodwill principles you’ve learned, and as usual, edit for punctuation and grammar.&nbsp;</span></p>

You need to present your readers with a compelling argument as to why they should do what you ask. The goal of this assignment is to persuade your audience to complete your request.</span></p>
<p><strong>Skills. </strong><span>The purpose of this assignment is to help you practice the following skills essential to effective communication in the workplace:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1""><span>Recognize what types of messages are categorized as persuasive messages.</span></li>
<li aria-level=""1""><span>Evaluate the best approaches to individual writing situations and create appropriate, effective workplace communication (professional communication).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Knowledge. </strong><span>By writing a persuasive message, you will improve your skills in convincing your audience to comply with your requests. This assignment will help you become familiar with the following content knowledge in this discipline:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1""><span>ANSA message format.</span></li>
<li aria-level=""1""><span>Proper formal business letter structure.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #236fa1;""><strong>Task. </strong>For this assignment, you will write a formal business letter to a successful local company (you pick one) from the non-profit organization New Start Families. You are asking this company to commit to fill three entry-level positions with the adult family members you are housing in your family-only homeless shelter.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #236fa1;"">Companies support local non-profit organizations for many reasons. These reasons are often more related to the company reputation and branding than to pure, charitable motives. So rather than telling your audience that “stable, full-time employment combined with the resources and training offered by New Start Families has an 85 percent success rate for raising families permanently out of housing insecurity,” think about who your audience is, what they care about, and what is important to them. While that statistic is probably personally interesting and important to your readers, they are acting on behalf of a company and have responsibilities for how they allot corporate resources that are earmarked for community engagement or charitable donations. They are also responsible for hiring people who will advance the company’s best interests in productivity and profitability. Think about how you can appeal to the company’s priorities to convince them that filling three entry-level positions from people currently living in a homeless shelter will benefit them in some way.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #236fa1;"">Ask your target company for a specific commitment or action by a specific date. Tie your request back into the company’s push for community engagement. From this company’s perspective, what are their needs and how is your request a solution?</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #236fa1;"">Within your letter, make reference to the following online article that discusses the benefits to corporations of giving back to their communities. Use this article to support your request, showing a potential benefit for your employer.</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.mageworx.com/blog/donations-benefit-for-ecommerce/""><span>""Five Ways Supporting Charities Can Benefit Your Business""</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Criteria for Success. </strong><span>Your writing will be evaluated according to the COS rubric. Remember to follow the recommended outline: ANSA. Use the goodwill principles you have learned. Edit for punctuation and grammar.</span></p>

As such, you should complete it yourself, without assistance from the Writing Lab or any other outside source. You have one week to write, edit, and submit this assignment.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong><span>. The purpose of this assignment is to apply the building goodwill principles and appropriate rhetorical strategies to a business writing scenario.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Skills</strong><span>. You will demonstrate your business writing knowledge by using the following steps:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1""><span>Analyze a business scenario.</span></li>
<li aria-level=""1""><span>Evaluate options to address the scenario.</span></li>
<li aria-level=""1""><span>Apply appropriate rhetorical concepts (GDP, NEMO, ANSA) to the problem.</span></li>
<li aria-level=""1""><span>Organize information so it is accessible to the reader.</span></li>
<li aria-level=""1""><span>Demonstrate writing that is inclusive, informed, and respectful of intercultural audiences.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task</strong><span>: Write a </span><i><span>formal email</span></i><span> to all employees of your international company outlining all of the training that is required and available. Include deadlines. Your email should not be more than a page long. Use graphics to make the information easy to scan. You will need to integrate all the rhetorical concepts we’ve learned this semester—good news, bad news, and persuasive—as this prompt requires elements of each. An international audience requires concrete, clear language that can be easily understood. You may want to use the writing process PASS from <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""http://mcom320.net/"" target=""_blank"">mcom320.net</a> <a class=""inline_disabled"" href=""http://mcom320.net/3plan.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Chapter 3</a> to formulate your message.</span></p>
<p><strong>Writing Prompt*: Training for All</strong></p>
<p><span>You are the global training manager for GreenTrees International, a non-profit organization that promotes global reforestation and conservation. In addition to managing the company training website (www.GreenTrees.org/learn), you also write emails to the employees of your corporation to inform them about mandatory training requirements and optional training opportunities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Although your company is headquartered in Japan, you work at the GreenAmerica division in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. Other main offices are in Paris, France; and Cape Town, South Africa; but you have satellite offices in 15 other countries. Because the global advisory board decided that English would be the official language of the company, your message will not be translated; therefore, it should be easily understood by the many employees for whom English is not their primary language.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This year’s mandatory trainings include the following topics: Sexual Harassment, Defensive Driving, Cybersecurity, Workplace Conduct, and Discrimination Prevention. Supervisors must complete additional Non-Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation Trainings. All training is offered online in English, and subtitles are available in 12 languages. These training modules are mandatory and must be completed by December 1, 2021. The training videos range from 10 to 35 minutes each, so employees should expect to spend two to three hours to complete them all. To complete this requirement, employees must complete a quiz at the end of each training and get at least 80 percent of the questions correct. Employees can rewatch the videos and retake the quizzes as many times as needed. No exemptions will be given, so every employee must complete these training modules on time.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, employees who participate in hiring committees should ensure their GreenHire certification is current. (Hiring training must be completed every two years.)</span></p>
<p><span>Optional trainings include (but are not limited to) employee development programs such as the GrowGreen Leadership training, GreenRoots Professional Development training, and GoGreen World Conservation training. Some of these are workshops that last several months and start at various times during the year. Employees can refer to the website for more details.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Criteria</strong><span>. Your submission will be evaluated by your instructor based on the COS rubric. This assessment counts for nearly half of your “Exams” category, which is 20 percent of your grade.</span></p>
<p><span>*Remember, you should use your <em>own words</em> when composing your email. This prompt, while grammatically correct, doesn’t use </span><i><span>you attitude</span></i><span> principles and is quite wordy. Also, because so much detailed information needs to be conveyed, you could consider using appropriate formatting techniques to make your message accessible to the reader.&nbsp;</span></p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,100.0,['online_upload'],1929556

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>. <span>The purpose of this assignment is to research, analyze, synthesize, validate, write, picture, design, and contribute to a professional business document—a newsletter.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Task</strong>.&nbsp;</span>Using each team member's article, create a two- or three-column newsletter for the company your team chose to work for. Use the document design principles and skills presented in Chapters 7 and 11. Include one references page for the whole newsletter that includes the sources used in the articles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because you are a UVU student, you have access to the Microsoft Office 365 Suite and can download it for free on any device. This gives you access to Word, PowerPoint, Publisher, and other applications, which you can use to design your newsletter. Chapters 7 and 11 of the online slidebook also link you to design software, which you can use as well. Just remember the four basic document design principles: contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity.</p>
<p>Adhere to the following guidelines.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an original letterhead—logos are nice but are not required.</li>
<li><span>Create a second-page header that includes the page number, day, and date of publication on top of the inside pages.</span></li>
<li>Add a headline and byline for each article. (A byline names the author of the article. It can be added after the headline or at the end of the article.)</li>
<li>Prepare at least one appropriate chart, graph, info graph, picture, or table for each article.</li>
<li>Include at least one pull quote per page. (A pull quote is a key phrase or excerpt pulled from the article to persuade readers to read the article.)</li>
<li>Use the Old/New Principle to create cohesive and coherent sentences, paragraphs, and articles.</li>
<li>Include the why, what, where, when, and how in the introductory paragraph to serve readers who skim for information—about two sentences. Add the other details in the paragraphs following the introductory paragraph.</li>
<li>Write clearly, concisely, correctly, and courteously.</li>
<li>Eliminate all typos and errors in punctuation and grammar.</li>
<li>Cite sources for facts, quotations, and graphics.</li>
</ul>
<p>This assignment is worth 100 points, which will be calculated into the final project portion of your grade.&nbsp;</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,100.0,['online_upload'],1929556

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Digital marketing promotes brands using all forms of digital technology which includes a variety of technologies like computers, tablets, smartphones, social media, and of course, the Internet.</p>
<p>In this class, you will gain some very basic digital marketing skills using the American Marketing Association Facebook page.</p>
<p>Digital Marketing is different from traditional marketing because you have an opportunity to heavily influence the buying process by engaging the people who influence the consumer. In the digital world, consumers are influenced by 3 groups: Referent Influencers, Expert Influencers, and Positional Influencers.</p>
<p>Referent Influencers – are the friends, classmates, roommates, and colleagues that influence your purchase</p>
<p>Expert Influencers – are the bloggers and other experts on the Internet that serve as a professionally qualified source that influence your decisions</p>
<p>Positional Influencers –are the people closest to you whose approval you seek. Usually this group of people is your family or very tight network.</p>

<p><strong>Unit #4 – Facebook Marketing Plan</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to unit #4 Facebook Digital Marketing Assignment. It is time to do some Market Research and write a simple, one-page Marketing Plan.&nbsp; The purpose of all marketing is to get consumers to buy something or to do something because it benefits the consumer and the producer. The UVU Marketing Department is the same as a business. The department wants to recruit more students to the Major by showing students the benefits --jobs, training, and community. Now you will be asked to work as a marketing consultant for the Department.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Look at the posts on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/AmericanMarketing/"">https://www.facebook.com/AmericanMarketing/</a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Identify 3 different types of posts (articles, events, pics, awards, memes, information, club etc…) and leave a comment on 3 different types of posts. Remember to use #profmsteed at the end of your comment.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now that you have had a semester of experiencing the UVU Marketing Department Facebook page it is time for you to become a marketing consultant. Based on your experience with the UVU Marketing Department Facebook page and your knowledge in the class, please write a one-page marketing plan. The paper should have the following organization and headers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Target Market —Who is the page trying to reach? Be specific by demographics, consumer behavior, and situation behavior.</li>
<li>Marketing Strategy—What should be the marketing strategy for the page? What is the page trying to persuade students to do? Is it effective? Why or Why not?</li>
<li>Content Strategy – What type of content should be on the page and what is the best posting schedule? How many posts, how often, and what is the best time of day for posting content?</li>
<li>Marketing Recommendation – Tell me one recommendation you have for recruiting more people to the Marketing Major.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;Remember to submit your Digital Marketing Assignment in Canvas by the due date at the end of Unit #4.&nbsp;</p>

518115,5386088,Discussion 5: Flexibility and Range of Motion,"<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118710790/canvas_global_app.css""><p>While many people perceive flexibility as the ability to ""touch your toes"" or ""do the splits"", from a health perspective, flexibility refers to having a healthy range of motion throughout our joints.&nbsp; According to <a href=""https://health.ucdavis.edu/sportsmedicine/resources/flexibility_descriprion.html"">UC Davis Health</a>, inadequate flexibility will have a negative effect on the body in 3 significant ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Joints that are unable to move through a full range of motion will not be able to maintain the health of cartilage and provide blood supply and nutrients. This effect can be particularly noticeable in weight bearing joints such as the hips and knees.</li>
<li>Muscles that are inflexible tire more quickly, causing opposing muscle groups to work harder. For example, the hamstrings play a role in stabilizing the knee and preventing ACL tears.</li>
<li>Decreased flexibility may also lead to abnormal stress on structures and tissues distant from the initial site of inflexibility. One example of this is that tendonitis in the knee can be related to calf tightness.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within your discussion groups <em>(they are already created, no need to sign up, just post below!)</em>, I would like you to discuss different methods of improving flexibility, joint range of motion, and core strength. Each group member will <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">create an original post</span> about a flexibility method (10 pts.), and <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">respond to 2 of their peers' posts</span> (5 pts.).</p>
<p>In your post, please describe:</p>
<ul>
<li>your chosen modality and its definition/description</li>
<li>its claimed benefits</li>
<li>YOUR EXPERIENCE- share your detailed workout - post link, class, etc.

<p>1. Answer each of the following, and explain your answer. Submit them here and bring a copy to class next time so we can talk about them.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;a. Can a valid argument have true premises and a true conclusion?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;b. Can an invalid&nbsp;argument have true premises and a true conclusion?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;c. Can a valid argument have true premises and a false conclusion?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;d. Can an invalid argument have true premises and a false conclusion?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;e. Can a valid argument have false premises and a true conclusion?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;f. Can an invalid argument have false premises and a true conclusion?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;g. Can a valid argument have false premises and a false conclusion?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;h. Can an invalid argument have false premises and a false conclusion?</p>
<p>2. Put the following into standard form.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is morally acceptable to tell a person with dementia a lie. People with dementia are sometimes subject to delusions. Telling someone that their delusion is incorrect doesn't work (because you can't reason with delusions) and is often counterproductive (because people can get very stressed or agitated when they think they are losing touch with reality). Not addressing the delusion/hallucination can be dangerous. For example, if a person with dementia believes they have to pick up their child from preschool when in reality, that child is fully grown and the person with dementia does not have a driver's license or ability to drive, letting that person persist in the delusion could result in traffic deaths. Telling someone a lie in this case (e.g., ""school is closed today"") helps the person with dementia and harms no one. It doesn't harm other people, and since the person with dementia will forget this lie soon, it can't harm them either. In cases like these, it is morally acceptable to tell a lie.

In this assignment, you will generate, analyze, and critically evaluate arguments about griefbots.</p>

<p><strong>Part 1: Generate two arguments with opposing conclusions about about whether consent should be required for people who are mourned as griefbots.</strong></p>
<p>NOTE : You&nbsp;<em>absolutely do</em><span>&nbsp;</span>need to cite your sources. Use<span>&nbsp;</span><a class=""external"" href=""https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html"" target=""_blank""><span>APA format</span><span class=""screenreader-only"">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a>. You&nbsp;<em>do</em><span>&nbsp;</span>need to use academic writing, and you&nbsp;<em>do&nbsp;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>need to write paragraphs (as opposed to bullet points).&nbsp;Also, don't put your argument in standard form. Write a paragraph. If your paragraph is clear, I should be able to put your argument in standard form.</p>
<p>I'm not looking for any specific word count. I'm looking for the quality of the argument. I'll be asking these questions:</p>
<p>1. Is there a conclusion? Is the conclusion clearly stated?</p>
<p>2. What are the premises? Are they clearly stated?</p>
<p>3. Does the author defend the premises where relevant? Is it clear what sub conclusions are in play?</p>
<p>4. Does the author consider relevant nuances when generating the premises?</p>
<p>We have talked in class about arguments, so you should know what a philosophical argument looks like. Your reader should be able to&nbsp;<em>analyze</em><span>&nbsp;</span>your argument, which is possible if you are clear about your conclusion and your premises. Make your argument as strong as possible by keeping in mind what we have learned about logic and validity. Also, where possible, support your premises.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2: Analyze the hypothetical argument by the fictional J. Doe below by (a) putting it in standard form, (b) diagramming it, and (c) writing an analysis paragraph.</strong></p>
<p>""Consent for people who are mourned as griefbots should not be required because consent is unnecessary. The point of consent is to protect people from harm, but dead people can't be harmed. They can't be harmed physically because they feel no pain. They can't be harmed emotionally either. Death is either complete annihilation or continued existence in another realm. If the dead person is completely annihilated, they can't have emotions. If they exist in another realm, their emotions can't be affected by what happens here. That's why dead people can't be harmed, so consent is unnecessary, and so it should not be required."" --J. Doe</p>
<p>NOTE: This will be graded based on completeness and effort. Don't stress if you don't think you did it correctly. This is a skill and you get better by practice.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3: Critically evaluate the argument in part 2. Remember: A</strong><span>&nbsp;critical evaluation i</span><span>s an argument you create a</span><span>bout an argument you’ve analyzed w</span><span>hose conclusion is about a premise in the argument you’ve analyzed. (</span><span>The conclusion can disagree with a premise (most common; easiest).&nbsp;</span><span>The conclusion can agree with a premise by giving novel reasons (less common; harder))</span></p>

Then you are to write an essay in which you connect&nbsp;</span><em>specific and specified</em><span>ideas in the film (characters, plot points, dialogue, etc.) to&nbsp;</span><em>specific and specified</em><span>&nbsp;ideas from the readings and from discussions in class. These &nbsp;connections serve to develop and defend a&nbsp;</span><strong>thesis</strong><span>&nbsp;about the readings that draws novel connections and makes insightful claims (see below for tips on how to develop a thesis). By developing and defending your thesis, you will grapple with the readings more deeply than we could in class, you will further develop your skills at generating arguments, and you will engage in independent, philosophical thinking.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: People occasionally have reasons for finding that a particular film would not be good for them to watch. If you would like an alternate assignment, please message me. Give me the general reason (you are not obligated to go into detail) so I can know it is for an approved reason (e.g., psychological well-being, cultural considerations, inability to view without children present) and not for non-approved reasons (e.g., I'm hoping for a shorter film, I don't like this kind of movie).</span></p>
<p><strong>Minimum requirements:</strong></p>
<p>1. 700-1000 words, single spaced, page numbers at the bottom center. No title page, no running head. &nbsp;The title and your name should be at the top, centered. Note that the word count is a ballpark&nbsp;<em>minimum</em>, and it is only provided to give people a sense of the depth I'm looking for. You are welcome and encouraged to write more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Works cited page that cites the film and the textbook (with as complete of information as you have). Papers that lack a works cited page and/or in text citations are considered plagiarized and will need to be rewritten and resubmitted.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Use this style for the pdfs: Last name, first name (year). ""Title.""&nbsp;<em>Journal Name</em><span>&nbsp;</span>(volume number): first page-last page.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Use this style for films: Director (year). Title.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in text citations, use this format: (author of article, year, page number).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in text citations of the films, use this format (time, title).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in text citations from the textbook, use this format: (author of chapter, title of chapter, page number.)</p>
<p>3. Has a THESIS that is supported by citing both the film and the textbook for a minimum of 5 connections. I'm looking for whether or not you&nbsp;<span>cite SPECIFIC things about the film and relate them to SPECIFIC things in the readings/class discussions. Note that the citation count is a ballpark&nbsp;<em>minimum</em>, and it is only provided to give people a sense of the depth I'm looking for. You are welcome and encouraged to cite more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;EXAMPLE: In UVU president Tuminez's remake of the classic&nbsp;<em>Bambi</em>, the scene where Bambi's mother dies (3:45-5:22 Bambi) contradicts Socrates's basic assertion that death is nothing to fear (Socrates, 2007, p. 20-21).</span></p>
<p>4. Does not include anything about yourself. (Do not include whether you liked the film, whether you are glad you saw it, or your opinion about the acting, style, casting, etc. Leave out all mere opinion.) Includes a brief synopsis of the film only as relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The papers are evaluated based on (1) the sophistication of the thesis, (2) the defense of the thesis, and (to a lesser extent), (3) mechanics (in text citations, work cited page, paragraph organization, grammar, etc.).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>C papers</strong>&nbsp;either don't have a thesis or don't support the thesis with specific citations that are quoted/paraphrased and interpreted. They talk about the film and readings in general ways that don't show careful note-taking and re-viewing/re-reading.</p>
<p><strong>B papers</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>have a thesis that says that there are connections/similarities/dissimilarities between the film and the reading(s). Sample thesis from a B &nbsp;paper:&nbsp;<em>Bambi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>has characters that act in utilitarian ways.</p>
<p><strong>A papers<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>go beyond juxtaposing the film and the readings and provide an original philosophical view. Sample thesis from an A paper:&nbsp;<em>Bambi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>can be understood as a refutation of virtue ethics. Another s<span>ample thesis from an A paper: Bambi shows that the theories of death that deny an afterlife will not adequately account for the trauma that those who remain face. Surprisingly, then, even though the film does not in any way discuss whether there is an afterlife, it nonetheless can be read as making an argument that only if there is an afterlife can we account for suffering.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Tips for generating a thesis:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>There's no formula for generating a quality thesis, but you can ask yourself these questions to help get you started.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Does the film challenge in a new way a theory/theories? How?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Does it undermine a particular view, or illustrate a particular view, or provide a further reason to believe a particular view? If so, how?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Does the film show a limitation of a particular theory/theories? Or does a theory show a limitation of a character in the film?</span></p>
<p><span>4. If we view the film through the lens of a theory, how would we evaluate a character/action?</span></p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,30.0,['online_upload'],1929556

Things that are eternal and have to do with conscience are more important than things that are not. Since moral laws are more important, we have a greater obligation to perform them. We have a right to protect our greater obligations. So pharmacists do have a right to refuse to refer or transfer prescriptions."" --J. Doe</p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;EXAMPLE: In UVU president Tuminez's remake of the classic&nbsp;<em>Bambi</em>, the scene where Bambi's mother dies (3:45-5:22 Bambi) contradicts Socrates's basic assertion that death is nothing to fear (Socrates, 2007, p. 20-21).</span></p>
<p>4. Does not include anything about yourself. (Do not include whether you liked the film, whether you are glad you saw it, or your opinion about the acting, style, casting, etc. Leave out all mere opinion.) Includes a brief synopsis of the film only as relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The papers are evaluated based on (1) the sophistication of the thesis, (2) the defense of the thesis, and (to a lesser extent), (3) mechanics (in text citations, work cited page, paragraph organization, grammar, etc.).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>C papers</strong>&nbsp;either don't have a thesis or don't support the thesis with specific citations that are quoted/paraphrased and interpreted. They talk about the film and readings in general ways that don't show careful note-taking and re-viewing/re-reading.</p>
<p><strong>B papers</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>have a thesis that says that there are connections/similarities/dissimilarities between the film and the reading(s). Sample thesis from a B &nbsp;paper:&nbsp;<em>Bambi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>has characters that act in utilitarian ways.</p>
<p><strong>A papers<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>go beyond juxtaposing the film and the readings and provide an original philosophical view. Sample thesis from an A paper:&nbsp;<em>Bambi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>can be understood as a refutation of virtue ethics. Another s<span>ample thesis from an A paper: Bambi shows that the theories of death that deny an afterlife will not adequately account for the trauma that those who remain face. Surprisingly, then, even though the film does not in any way discuss whether there is an afterlife, it nonetheless can be read as making an argument that only if there is an afterlife can we account for suffering.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Tips for generating a thesis:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>There's no formula for generating a quality thesis, but you can ask yourself these questions to help get you started.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Does the film challenge in a new way a theory/theories? How?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Does it undermine a particular view, or illustrate a particular view, or provide a further reason to believe a particular view? If so, how?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Does the film show a limitation of a particular theory/theories? Or does a theory show a limitation of a character in the film?</span></p>
<p><span>4. If we view the film through the lens of a theory, how would we evaluate a character/action?</span></p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,30.0,['online_upload'],1929556

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Part 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Generate two arguments with opposing conclusions about whether UVU professors should take Aristotle out of their Ethics and Values syllabus.</strong></p>
<p>NOTE : You&nbsp;<em>absolutely do</em><span>&nbsp;</span>need to cite your sources. Use<span>&nbsp;</span><a class=""external"" href=""https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html"" target=""_blank""><span>APA format</span><span class=""screenreader-only"">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a>. You&nbsp;<em>do</em><span>&nbsp;</span>need to use academic writing, and you&nbsp;<em>do&nbsp;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>need to write paragraphs (as opposed to bullet points).&nbsp;Also, don't put your argument in standard form. Write a paragraph. If your paragraph is clear, I should be able to put your argument in standard form.</p>
<p>I'm not looking for any specific word count. I'm looking for the quality of the argument. I'll be asking these questions:</p>
<p>1. Is there a conclusion? Is the conclusion clearly stated?</p>
<p>2. What are the premises? Are they clearly stated?</p>
<p>3. Does the author defend the premises where relevant? Is it clear what sub conclusions are in play?</p>
<p>4. Does the author consider relevant nuances when generating the premises?</p>
<p>We have talked in class about arguments, so you should know what a philosophical argument looks like. Your reader should be able to&nbsp;<em>analyze</em><span>&nbsp;</span>your argument, which is possible if you are clear about your conclusion and your premises. Make your argument as strong as possible by keeping in mind what we have learned about logic and validity. Also, where possible, support your premises.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Part 2: Analyze the hypothetical argument by the fictional J. Doe below by (a) putting it in standard form, (b) diagramming it, and (c) writing an analysis paragraph.</strong></p>
<p>""Aristotle should not be taught in UVU's Ethics and Values classes. The reason isn't that he had immoral views. The reason is instead that we can't argue with him about his immoral views. This is because he is dead, so he has the last word on slavery from his own perspective. If you can't argue with someone about their views, then this defeats the whole point of an Ethics class, which is to come up with and understand arguments in order to think better. Additionally, there are other people who talk about virtue ethics but who don't advocate for slavery. These people, consequently, have views about virtue ethics that are inherently superior to Aristotle's. So these people should replace Aristotle on the syllabus."" --J. Doe</p>
<p>NOTE: This will be graded based on completeness and effort. Don't stress if you don't think you did it correctly. This is a skill and you get better by practice.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3: Critically evaluate the argument in part 2. Remember: A</strong><span>&nbsp;critical evaluation i</span><span>s an argument you create a</span><span>bout an argument you’ve analyzed w</span><span>hose conclusion is about a premise in the argument you’ve analyzed. (</span><span>The conclusion can disagree with a premise (most common; easiest).&nbsp;</span><span>The conclusion can agree with a premise by giving novel reasons (less common; harder).)</span></p>

<p><strong>CHECKLIST: Make sure your assignment has all of these components.</strong></p>
<p><strong>PART 1:&nbsp;</strong>This part should have two paragraphs. Each paragraph gives an argument, but they have opposing conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>PART 2A:&nbsp;</strong>Here you'll put the argument by J. Doe in standard form.</p>
<p><strong>PART 2B:&nbsp;</strong>Here you'll give a diagram of what you wrote in 2A.</p>
<p><strong>PART</strong>&nbsp;<strong>2C:&nbsp;</strong>Here you'll write an analysis paragraph of J. Doe's argument.</p>
<p><strong>PART 3:&nbsp;</strong>Here you'll write a critical evaluation of J. Doe's argument.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",True,30.0,['online_upload'],1929556

Then you are to write an essay in which you connect&nbsp;<em>specific and specified</em> ideas in the film (characters, plot points, dialogue, etc.) to&nbsp;<em>specific and specified</em> ideas from the readings and from discussions in class.</p>
<p>Minimum requirements:</p>
<p>1. 700-1000 words, single spaced, page numbers at the bottom center. No title page, no running head. &nbsp;The title and your name should be at the top, centered.</p>
<p>2. Works cited page that cites the film and the textbook (with as complete of information as you have). Papers that lack a works cited page and/or in text citations are considered plagiarized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Use this style for the textbook: Last name, first name (year). Title.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Use this style for films: Director (year). Title.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in text citations, use this format: (author of article, year, page number).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in text citations of the films, use this format (time, title).</p>
<p>3. Has a THESIS that is supported by citing both the film and the textbook for a minimum of 5 connections. I'm looking for whether or not you&nbsp;<span>cite SPECIFIC things about the film and relate them to SPECIFIC things in the readings/class discussions. Papers that fail to cite BOTH the film AND the textbook a minimum number of 5 times in a relevant way will receive a zero.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;EXAMPLE: In UVU president Tuminez's remake of the classic <em>Bambi</em>, the scene where Bambi's mother dies (3:45-5:22 Bambi) contradicts Weigel's basic assertion that death is just another part of life (Weigel, 2019, p. 1).</span></p>
<p>4. Does not include anything about yourself. (Do not include whether you liked the film, whether you are glad you saw it, or your opinion about the acting, style, casting, etc. Leave out all mere opinion.) Includes a brief synopsis only as relevant.</p>
<p><strong>C papers</strong> meet these minimum requirements only. They state how thing x in the film is similar to or dissimilar to thing y in the reading. Because they display a basic comprehension only, they do not make arguments to back up their claims.</p>
<p>Sample claim from a C paper: <span>In UVU president Tuminez's remake of the classic <em>Bambi</em>, the scene where Bambi's mother dies (3:45-5:22 Bambi) contradicts Weigel's basic assertion that death is just another part of life (Weigel, 2019).</span></p>
<p><strong>B papers</strong> provide additional depth or insight. Instead of saying just that thing x in the film is similar or dissimilar to thing y in the reading, B papers additionally touch on some of these questions</p>
<p><span>1. Does the film challenges in a new way a theory/theories? How?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Does it undermine a particular view, or illustrate a particular view, or provide a further reason to believe a particular view? If so, how?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Does the film show a limitation of a particular theory/theories? Or does a theory show a limitation of a character in the film?</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, B papers more thoroughly&nbsp;quote, cite and explain particular aspects of the readings and the film to back up their claims. They talk about specific passages in each and explain their relevance to the claim they are making.</span></p>
<p><span>Sample claim from a B paper: In UVU president Tuminez's remake of the classic <em>Bambi</em>, the scene where Bambi's mother dies (3:45-5:22 Bambi) contradicts Weigel's basic assertion that death is just another part of life (Weigel, 2019, p. 2). For Bambi's mother, death is just another progression, but Bambi herself is devastated. For Bambi, this event changes everything. She spends the rest of her life having terrible relationships (25:34-38:35 and 44:55-49:68 Bambi, for example). Since Weigel says that even for those who remain, other people's death is just another part of life, Weigel's view is limited.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>A papers </strong>not&nbsp;only provide depth and insight; additionally, they&nbsp;connect themes in a way that develops an original thesis. They show independent readings--in other words, they go beyond what was said in class to draw new connections. Their views give an enriched understanding of both the reading(s) and the film: they show why juxtaposing them provides new insight.</span></p>

Ideally, such spiritual exercises make us less worried and more fulfilled. They might make us more self-aware, or less dominated by negative emotions, or more attentive to the world around us.

<p>Each class period that is devoted to discussion (e.g., not the midterm or group project or review days), you will spend the last 15 minutes devoted to writing a meditative exercise.

<p>To prepare yourself for our class discussions, you will need to do each reading closely and carefully. To demonstrate this, and to help guide our discussions, you will need to provide <strong>ten things</strong> per reading. These ten things can be any combination of the following, so long as you have at least one #3 or #4. Each one should refer to a <strong>specific page number</strong> and each one should be <strong>labeled </strong>as a basic question, observation, critical thinking question, or argument. NOTE: most classes we will have two readings, so you will turn in 20 things total. These are due before class and cannot be turned in late, but you can drop your two lowest scores. NOTE: I have multiple sections in this canvas course. The due time is 10am, but if you are in my noon section, it won't be counted as late (even though Canvas will say it is late) if you turn it in by noon, and if you are in my 2pm section, it won't be counted as late (even though Canvas will say it is late) if you turn it in by 2pm.</p>
<ol>
<li>Basic Questions: The questions can be about terms, concepts, ideas, arguments, or passages, but they <em>must</em> refer to a specific page number.
<ol>
<li>Example: On p. 2 of <em>The Apology,</em> in the first paragraph, I got lost in the discussion of older charges and newer charges. What are each of these charges?</li>
<li>Example: On p. 9 of <em>The Apology</em>, how is Meletus defining an atheist?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Observations: Here you can make any observation about anything you have read. Avoid personal attacks or opinions about your own experience as you do the reading.
<ol>
<li>Example: Sometimes, like on p. 4, Socrates seems really humble, but sometimes when he talks to Meletus, he seems quite arrogant.</li>
<li>But NOT anything like these: I dislike Socrates. Socrates is a total jerk. I found the reading boring/interesting.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Critical thinking questions: By a critical thinking question, I mean a question that examines a premise or an underlying assumption in an argument.
<ol>
<li>Example: On p. 8, Socrates says that no one likes to be injured, but how can that be true when people do dangerous things that end up in injury all the time (like risky driving or things like that)?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Arguments: Here you can make a claim and support it with reasons. These are the best, and you should strive for as many as possible.
<ol>
<li>Example: On pp. 20-21 when Socrates says that if death is like sleep, it will be great, he is making a false analogy. Sleep is only great because it feels good when you wake up. But if Socrates thinks death is permanent, then we never wake up. So death isn’t really like sleep.</li>

<p>To prepare yourself for our class discussions, you will need to do each reading closely and carefully. To demonstrate this, and to help guide our discussions, you will need to provide <strong>ten things</strong> per reading. These ten things can be any combination of the following, so long as you have at least one #3 or #4. Each one should refer to a <strong>specific page number</strong> and each one should be <strong>labeled </strong>as a basic question, observation, critical thinking question, or argument. NOTE: most classes we will have two readings, so you will turn in 20 things total. These are due before class and cannot be turned in late, but you can drop your two lowest scores. NOTE: I have multiple sections in this canvas course. The due time is 10am, but if you are in my noon section, it won't be counted as late (even though Canvas will say it is late) if you turn it in by noon, and if you are in my 2pm section, it won't be counted as late (even though Canvas will say it is late) if you turn it in by 2pm.</p>
<ol>
<li>Basic Questions: The questions can be about terms, concepts, ideas, arguments, or passages, but they <em>must</em> refer to a specific page number.
<ol>
<li>Example: On p. 2 of <em>The Apology,</em> in the first paragraph, I got lost in the discussion of older charges and newer charges. What are each of these charges?</li>
<li>Example: On p. 9 of <em>The Apology</em>, how is Meletus defining an atheist?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Observations: Here you can make any observation about anything you have read. Avoid personal attacks or opinions about your own experience as you do the reading.
<ol>
<li>Example: Sometimes, like on p. 4, Socrates seems really humble, but sometimes when he talks to Meletus, he seems quite arrogant.</li>
<li>But NOT anything like these: I dislike Socrates. Socrates is a total jerk. I found the reading boring/interesting.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Critical thinking questions: By a critical thinking question, I mean a question that examines a premise or an underlying assumption in an argument.
<ol>
<li>Example: On p. 8, Socrates says that no one likes to be injured, but how can that be true when people do dangerous things that end up in injury all the time (like risky driving or things like that)?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Arguments: Here you can make a claim and support it with reasons. These are the best, and you should strive for as many as possible.
<ol>
<li>Example: On pp. 20-21 when Socrates says that if death is like sleep, it will be great, he is making a false analogy. Sleep is only great because it feels good when you wake up. But if Socrates thinks death is permanent, then we never wake up. So death isn’t really like sleep.</li>

<li>Example: On pp. 20-21 when Socrates says that if death is like sleep, it will be great, he is making a false analogy. Sleep is only great because it feels good when you wake up. But if Socrates thinks death is permanent, then we never wake up. So death isn’t really like sleep.</li>

<p>To prepare yourself for our class discussions, you will need to do each reading closely and carefully. To demonstrate this, and to help guide our discussions, you will need to provide <strong>ten things</strong> per reading. These ten things can be any combination of the following, so long as you have at least one #3 or #4. Each one should refer to a <strong>specific page number</strong> and each one should be <strong>labeled </strong>as a basic question, observation, critical thinking question, or argument. NOTE: most classes we will have two readings, so you will turn in 20 things total. These are due before class and cannot be turned in late, but you can drop your two lowest scores. NOTE: I have multiple sections in this canvas course. The due time is 10am, but if you are in my noon section, it won't be counted as late (even though Canvas will say it is late) if you turn it in by noon, and if you are in my 2pm section, it won't be counted as late (even though Canvas will say it is late) if you turn it in by 2pm.</p>
<ol>
<li>Basic Questions: The questions can be about terms, concepts, ideas, arguments, or passages, but they <em>must</em> refer to a specific page number.
<ol>
<li>Example: On p. 2 of <em>The Apology,</em> in the first paragraph, I got lost in the discussion of older charges and newer charges. What are each of these charges?</li>
<li>Example: On p. 9 of <em>The Apology</em>, how is Meletus defining an atheist?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Observations: Here you can make any observation about anything you have read. Avoid personal attacks or opinions about your own experience as you do the reading.
<ol>
<li>Example: Sometimes, like on p. 4, Socrates seems really humble, but sometimes when he talks to Meletus, he seems quite arrogant.</li>
<li>But NOT anything like these: I dislike Socrates. Socrates is a total jerk. I found the reading boring/interesting.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Critical thinking questions: By a critical thinking question, I mean a question that examines a premise or an underlying assumption in an argument.
<ol>
<li>Example: On p. 8, Socrates says that no one likes to be injured, but how can that be true when people do dangerous things that end up in injury all the time (like risky driving or things like that)?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Arguments: Here you can make a claim and support it with reasons. These are the best, and you should strive for as many as possible.
<ol>
<li>Example: On pp. 20-21 when Socrates says that if death is like sleep, it will be great, he is making a false analogy. Sleep is only great because it feels good when you wake up. But if Socrates thinks death is permanent, then we never wake up. So death isn’t really like sleep.</li>

<li>30-35 minutes per group.</li>
<li>Turn in a <strong>bibliography</strong> at the time of your presentation, OR leave it on your screen long enough for me to look at it. The bibliography should have at least two scholarly sources, two popular/news sources, and one reference source. It should also use your starter reading(s) (see above). Submit it under the group project assignment on Canvas. Only one person needs to submit this, but that person must include everyone's names.</li>
<li>I expect everyone in the group to contribute to all of the components. In other words, do <em>not</em> assign people part 1 or part 2. It is fine if different people take the lead on a part, but everyone should contribute to the whole project. Your presentation should be a seamless whole, not a patchwork of different parts that do not cohere.</li>
<li>Do not think of the components below as an outline or order you must follow. I will be looking for all of these elements, but you can present them in a creative way, and should present them in an interesting way.</li>

<p class=""Notannoying"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Notannoying"">Components of presentation:</p>
<ol>
<li>An explanation of the <em>facts</em> and <em>background.</em>
<ol>
<li>People who do not know about the issue should come away with a solid understanding of what the issue is.</li>
<li>People should know why this issue is important and why they should care about it.</li>
<li>You can use a video here, but the clip should be short, and you should not use it as a substitute for explaining something yourself.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>An explanation of the relevant <em>positions</em>.
<ol>
<li>You should indicate the pro and con (and middle, if any) positions. You should indicate the <em>arguments </em>people give for each of these positions.</li>
<li>You should indicate to what extent, if any, these arguments are based on or implicitly draw on any of the <em>theories</em> we have studied (virtue ethics, utilitarianism, deontology).</li>
<li>You should diagnose the disagreement (i.e., show how the disagreement is rooted in differing underlying theories, using anything we’ve studied this semester).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A brief (1-2 minute per person) explanation of <em>what you’ve learned </em>from this project and <em>what your position is</em>.</li>
<li>A bibliography, which you also submit here. It should contain the names of everyone in the project.</li>

<li>People should know why this issue is important and why they should care about it.</li>
<li>You can use a video here, but the clip should be short, and you should not use it as a substitute for explaining something yourself.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>An explanation of the relevant<span>&nbsp;</span><em>positions</em>.
<ol>
<li>You should indicate the pro and con (and middle, if any) positions. You should indicate the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>arguments<span>&nbsp;</span></em>people give for each of these positions.</li>
<li>You should indicate to what extent, if any, these arguments are based on or implicitly draw on any of the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>theories</em><span>&nbsp;</span>we have studied (virtue ethics, utilitarianism, deontology).</li>
<li>You should diagnose the disagreement (i.e., show how the disagreement is rooted in differing underlying theories, using anything we’ve studied this semester).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A brief (1-2 minute per person) explanation of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>what you’ve learned<span>&nbsp;</span></em>from this project and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>what your position is</em>.</li>

<p>1. Make sure your name is not on your exam. 10% off if your name appears anywhere. I grade these anonymously, so this is very important.</p>
<p>2. Make sure you have answered BOTH questions. There is an analyze/critically evaluate question AND a term to explain.</p>
<p>3. Use a .doc, .docx or .pdf file format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>This exam is open notes and open book. You may not use the internet or any electronics for any reason (unless you have pre-approved it with me ahead of time or you have an accessibility accommodation)(except for writing and turning in the exam). &nbsp;I will fill in the TBAs 1-2 days before the midterm. You will have at least 24 hours (midnight to midnight); you can get half credit for turning it in late.</p>
<p><strong>Plagiarism&nbsp;</strong><strong>(having someone help you take the exam, talking about the exam to other people after you’ve seen it and before you’ve turned it in, coping the work of others, published or not, without proper citation, etc.) results in failure of the class.

<p><strong>The study guide is the notes I put on the board and the explanations I give in class. The exam in part teaches you to take good notes and measures how well you do so. It reflects how prepared you are in class and how much you use class to challenge and deepen your thinking.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>REQUIRED QUESTION #1 Essay: (60%)</strong></p>
<p><em>Answer the following prompt in a well-written essay. When you quote an author from the textbook/in class readings, cite the page number (but you do not need a works cited page). Be sure to explain clearly and completely any philosophical terms that arise in your answer.</em></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14pt; background-color: #ffff00;""><em><strong>Analyze and critically evaluate Socrates's argument that he is being falsely prosecuted for corrupting the youth.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><strong>REQUIRED QUESTION #2 Explaining concepts (short&nbsp;answer): (40%)</strong></p>
<p><em>Explain the concept’s philosophical meaning. Contextualize the concept by showing what philosopher used it and how they used it. Contextualize the concept within the larger debate. When you quote an author, cite the page number (but you do not need a works cited page).</em></p>

<h3><strong>Design/build: Paper/foam plate plane (Course objective 2)</strong></h3>
<p>Create a plane from a paper plate or a foam plate: Using only one or two paper plates or foam plates, tape, and a penny (optional), build a paper plate airplane that flies a minimum distance of twelve feet while remaining right side up. Using regular paper is not allowed and will result in no points given.</p>
<p>You can find templates on the Internet and you are also free (and encouraged) to experiment.&nbsp; Think about what makes a plane fly and you can probably create your own cool invention.</p>
<p>Take a short video of the flight and submit the file on Canvas. You may also upload the video to Youtube, Vimeo, etc. and submit the URL.<span>&nbsp;</span><i>As usual, this must be original work</i>. If the video is greater than 5MB then you must upload the file to YouTube, Vimeo, etc. and submit the URL.</p>
<p><span>To obtain credit for this assignment your&nbsp;video must have include:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>You holding or demonstrating your creation</span></li>
<li><span>Verification that it flew a minimum of twelve feet</span></li>

<p><em>Note: A C<sub>60</sub> buckyball is a molecule composed of 60 carbon atoms that resembles the shape of a soccer ball.&nbsp; Each buckyball has thirty two faces (twelve pentagons&nbsp;and&nbsp;twenty hexagons),&nbsp;ninety edges,&nbsp;and sixty vertices (the atoms).&nbsp; <u>Important</u>: When your buckyball molecular model has the correct shape, each of the twelve pentagon shapes will be surrounded by five hexagons and no pentagon will be touching another pentagon. Refer to the image to ensure your model is complete and correct. </em></p>

<h3><strong>Graphical: Winter ready dog door (Course objective 2)</strong></h3>
<p>Its time to put on your design thinking cap and define, ideate, and prototype! Here is the situation: Winters can be very cold based on where you live. Dog owners who live in these cold parts have been stuck with drafty and thin dog doors. You have been asked to find a potential solution for this problem. However, the solution cannot cost more than $100 per door and must function for dogs up to 60 pounds. They must be able go in and out with ease on their own when the owner is not present. It has to function better than simply putting a blanket or something similar over the dog door flap or having a thinly insulated flap itself.&nbsp; Be original; that is what design thinking is largely about - finding new solutions.&nbsp; Sketch your solution as professionally as possible and offer detail for your instructor to be clear on how it would function.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, this is worth 20 points, subsequently it needs a good amount of effort, thought, and clarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Graphical: Semi-autonomous Gun Rules (Course objective 3) THURSDAY END</strong></h3>
<p><span>Based on&nbsp;the textbook chapter for this module and considering, in particular, the segment on international defense, you have been asked to recommend rules and regulations for the use of <em>semi-autonomous</em> (semi-autonomous is different than semi-automatic) guns in the United States for civilian and well as governmental use.&nbsp; What would you recommend and why? Create a visual communication (conveyance of ideas and information in forms that can be seen) that addresses these concerns (200 word minimum).</span></p>
<p>Important note: If you do semi-automatic instead of semi-autonomous you will get zero points for the assignment</p>

<h3><strong>Graphical: Blender (Course objective 3)</strong></h3>
<p>Graphical: Blender (Course objective 3)<br>The chapter discusses computer-aided design and its role in manufacturing; In some ways it is changing how we communicate about our needs or expectations. Modeling and prototyping is becoming increasingly important. &nbsp;<a href=""https://www.blender.org/"">Blender</a> is a free 3D modeling software that can be used to create a simple 3D object. Obtain this software and make a simple 3D model of a donut or table or some other simple item (it has to be more complex than a sphere or a box).</p>
