After viewing the comedic material delivered my fellow peer, Tristan Miskimins, I came to the conclusion to give his jokes an official score of four. The reason I gave these jokes a four instead of a five is due to the background knowledge that the second joke required. The good part about the jokes were that they were original, to a degree, and required some background knowledge to understand them. The bad part of the jokes was the delivery, I wish he were slightly more animated when telling them.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-01-29T06:59:59Z,10,10.0,False,2021-01-28T21:17:19Z

On page 115, last full paragraph, Parenti is describing a story that involves a VCSU operation taking place at a gas station in Fresno, California, ""As the first cruiser approaches, six young African American men on the corner start moving away: that's suspicious behavior, probable cause for a stop."" Just from this short excerpt of the story, I can already identify an issue with present day policing techniques, racial profiling. Although the area in this story has a past of being a hot spot for criminal behavior, it still shows how police are assuming the worst in African American men and women.</p>
<p>On pages 116-117, last full paragraph and first full paragraph respectively, Parenti is describing another story involving a VCSU operation in which, ""A unit has 'contact' on the far end of the Dog Pound, and on foot an individual has fled the scene of a traffic stop, entering a nearby house... Technically [the officers] are not in hot pursuit and have no right to storm the building, but they look angry and their guns make it seem serious, so the elderly woman behind the black metal security gate quickly consents to a search."" From the last part of this excerpt, where 'the elderly woman behind the black metal security gate quickly consents to a search,' it can be concluded that if the officers had not been carrying an immense amount of firepower and high tech gadgets, the elderly woman most likely would not have consented to a search without a warrant. This presents the argument of which I would like to write on, the unjust behavior police present that goes against the fourth amendment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The topic of racial profiling is a severe social injustice in that it is the equivalent of modern day segregation. Although we no longer segregate restaurants and schools by race, the way we treat minorities, primarily African Americans and Latinos, shows just how far we have to go in order to be a just society. One example from the text that perfectly illustrates my point is shown on page 168, sixth sentence, when Parenti states, ""Prison also mops up huge numbers of poor African American, Latino, and Native American people."" This statement shows how cops assume that almost all criminals are of the races identified by Parenti in this last statement. If you have seen the television series Breaking Bad, then you should know that Caucasian people can be criminals as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In regards to my second identified topic, that of the the unjust police behavior present that goes against the fourth amendment, there are multiple points I would like to discuss the contemporary relevance of this topic. In recent news articles, I have seen numerous stories of police officers getting in trouble for conducting a traffic stop without real probable cause or reasonable suspicion. I personally feel these two phrases are extremely generalized and they give police too much power. When police stop a car for no good reason, the actual reason seems to be that of racial profiling or an unjust search. This topic is a very big social injustice because it causes everyday people to become afraid every time they come in contact with a police officer, or even see a police vehicle while driving at the speed limit.&nbsp;</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",2,,2021-02-04T06:59:59Z,10,10.0,True,2021-02-08T16:03:37Z

<p>In order to narrow my research, I will be focusing on the use of racial profiling in routine traffic stops.

<p>2. The sources I plan on using as part of my research include:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1)&nbsp;Baumgartner, Frank R., et al.&nbsp;<i>Suspect Citizens : What 20 Million Traffic Stops Tell Us about Policing and Race</i>. Cambridge University Press, 2018.&nbsp;<i>EBSCOhost</i>, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cat07712a&amp;AN=flc.437007&amp;site=eds-live.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a) This book analyzes data pulled from police departments across the nation that shows the relationship between routine traffic stops and racial profiling. By looking at why the police officers pulled a motorist over, the rate of arrests as a result of the traffic stops, and any abuse or mistreatment of civilians by officers, this book illustrates the showcases the real issue behind racial profiling in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b) This source will help me develop background knowledge on my topic by presenting me with data and statistics that will help support my argument and provide me insight into the reasons why police officers use racial profiling as a means of arrest or abuse.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Epp, Charles R., et al.&nbsp;<i>Pulled over : How Police Stops Define Race and Citizenship</i>. The University of Chicago Press, 2014.&nbsp;<i>EBSCOhost</i>, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cat07712a&amp;AN=flc.172985&amp;site=eds-live.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a) This book identifies the reasoning behind racial profiling by police officers and the justification for those reasons given by those officers by interviewing both the officers and civilians involved in the traffic stops to provide clear insight into both why the officers use racial profiling as a means to pull over a motorist and how the motorist reacts when they are pulled over for that reason alone.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b) This source will help me develop background knowledge on my topic by providing me with very detailed insight into the minds and thought patterns of the parties involved in traffic stops in which racial profiling was evident. By looking at both sides of the issue, this source will give me more opportunities to enhance my argument and help me avoid becoming biased on this particular topic.</span></p>
<p><span>3. The Southern region of the United States, primarily the South Eastern region, has been the epicenter of race-fueled hate crimes and racial profiling ever since the Revolutionary War. The relationship between African American civilians and law enforcement officials has been a rising issue in recent years. Although some progress has been made in regards to the treatment of African American citizens, the rate at which law enforcement officials are wrongly pulling over motorists is dramatically slowing the pace of achieving social justice in the United States (Baumgartner et. al 29). One can easily assume that this is simply an opinion being presented as facts, however, data never lies. A dataset pulled from a database that holds the records of every traffic stop in the state of North Carolina from 2002 through 2016 shows ""that about 20 percent of [adolescent] pedestrian encounters... 'almost [never] turn up guns (0.11 percent of all stops) or other contraband (1.5 percent).'"" (Baumgartner et al 29). After looking at these statistics, it's difficult to argue against the fact that law enforcement officials are using biased political views to identify potential criminals. North Carolina may be the only state represented in this report, though these types of trends can be found across the United States.</span></p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-02-19T06:59:59Z,20,20.0,False,2021-02-19T04:38:33Z

Traffic stops on the grounds of reasonable suspicion for drug possession should be banned because they are ineffective at preventing and stopping crime, create distrust between law enforcement officials and the community, and are the primary cause of racial biases among police departments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another source I analyzed during the research process was an academic journal article written by Jocelyn Simonson. Throughout the article, Simonson illustrates the history and meaning of the current national police reform. While introducing the contents of the article, the author states, “that policing practices should reduce crime, make people feel safe, and promote trust between police officers and communities.” (Simonson 793) While there are minor changes being brought about on a national level, state and local law enforcement agencies are working together through an approach that Simonson describes as an “instrumental approach” (Simonson 794). The overall goal of this approach is for state and local law enforcement agencies to work together by collecting data from body cam footage, crash reports, and surveillance footage to accurately identify and prevent police brutality and act against the officers involved (Simonson 797). By collecting and analyzing these datasets, analysts can identify trends, predict situational outcomes, and present statistics to help inform, persuade, and inspire government officials to make changes in the way law enforcement takes place (Simonson 808). As an Information Systems Major, I fully support this approach because of the way it presents facts and supports decision making rather than using the intuition of biased sources to make changes in the criminal justice system. Although data analysis and visualization tools are not perfect, they can identify accurate data trends and predictions in a timely manner. One program that is currently being used for this purpose is known as, “CompStat for Justice”, “which provides the ability to add additional metrics such as use of force statistics and the results of community surveys.” (Simonson 808) This example illustrates the current capabilities of the law enforcement agencies and the potential positive impact it can have on police reform movements across the United States.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;<em>The Social Network,&nbsp;</em>a film released in 2010, combines fact and fiction about an idea of Harvard Student Mark Zuckerberg that he and some classmates turned into a&nbsp;<em>succes fou.</em></p>
<p>2. The screenplay was adapted from&nbsp;<em>The Accidental Billionaires,&nbsp;</em>a 2009 book by Ben Mezrich.</p>
<p>3. While&nbsp;<em>The Social Network&nbsp;</em>lost out to&nbsp;<em>The King's Speech&nbsp;</em>for the Academy Award for best picture, the former won Oscars for best adapted screenplay, original score, and film editing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Many critics, including Peter Travers in&nbsp;<em>Rolling Stone&nbsp;</em>magazine, praised the Facebook film, while Zuckerberg pointed out its inaccuracies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. The term&nbsp;<em>social networking&nbsp;</em>had a meaning of its own before it became synonymous with social-networking websites.</p>
<p>6. The word&nbsp;<em>facebook&nbsp;</em>was originally the nickname of a publication of photographs that some colleges gave to students at the beginning of the school year to help them get to know each other.</p>
<p>7. Two earlier versions of the Facebook site were called Facemash and Thefacebook.</p>
<p>8. Harvard has not allowed filming on its campus since&nbsp;<em>Love Story,&nbsp;</em>a 1970 release, so&nbsp;<em>The Social Network&nbsp;</em>was filmed elsewhere.</p>
<p>9. The movie about building Facebook is hardly the first time Hollywood has woven fiction into real-life events. The 1912 sinking of the ocean liner Titanic is another story that was changed in a film.</p>
<p>10. Not everyone loves Facebook; some people consider it the&nbsp;<em>antisocial&nbsp;</em>network.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-03-20T05:59:59Z,15,15.0,False,2021-03-14T23:35:14Z

<li>Steroids are performance-enhancing drugs, indeed; they build muscle mass and strength, which lead to better results in competition.</li>
<li>Steroids are synthetic forms of the male hormone testosterone; megadoses of steroids give users an unfair advantage.</li>
<li>Males in good health usually produce less than ten milligrams of testosterone a day; athletes on steroids swallow or inject hundreds of milligrams a day.</li>
<li>In adults, steroids cause rapid weight gain, problems with blood clotting, and heart attacks; in adolescents they can shut down bone growth.</li>
<li>Signs of steroid use are jaundice, or yellow skin, sudden combative behavior, excessive vomiting that lasts more than a few days, and swollen feet.</li>
<li>Athletes who later admitted steroid use include Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds, the baseball stars; Marion Jones, the track star; and Lance Armstrong, the cyclist.</li>
<li>McGwire surpassed Roger Maris’s season home-run record of sixty; Bonds beat McGwire’s number and set the record for most career home runs as well.</li>
<li>In 2013, Alex Rodriguez was suspended for 211 games for allegedly using steroids; thirteen other major-league baseball players were also suspended, but A-Rod was the only one to appeal his suspension.</li>
<li>A 2012 report by the Associated Press claimed college football players use steroids; it suggested that colleges knowingly look the other way.</li>
<li>Books about steroid use in athletics include <em>Game of Shadows, </em>2007; <em>Bases Loaded, </em>2009; and <em>Steroids: A New Look, </em>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. In&nbsp;<em>The Twilight Saga</em>, high school student Bella Swan moved from Arizona to Washington, where she fell in love with Edward Cullen, a vampire.</p>
<p>2. Readers of the saga may be relieved when they learn that Edward drinks animal blood rather than human blood, but still they must wonder how safe Bella is.</p>
<p>3. Bella and Edward have a daughter who is half vampire and half human.</p>
<p>4. Librarians report that parents and educators have frequently challenged the books, which are most popular among young adults; librarians routinely keep careful records of challenges to books.</p>
<p>5. Some adults challenged the series for its explicit sexual scenes and religious viewpoint; others categorized the writing as ""abstinence pornography.""</p>
<p>6. Although Stephenie Meyer had originally signed a contract with the publisher for three books, she ended up writing four.</p>
<p>7. The&nbsp;<em>Times&nbsp;</em>of London claimed that the author conveyed well ""the teenage feeling of sexual tension and alienation,"" but other critics expressed concern over scenes in which Edward abused Bella.</p>
<p>8. The author maintained that she did not intend an antiwoman message, arguing that Bella is in control and makes her own decisions.</p>
<p>9. Meyer noted that her writing was influenced by that of Jane Austen and Emily Bronte, but critics' opinions of it range from ""serviceable prose"" to ""banal mediocrity.""</p>
<p>10. In folklore, vampires are corpses who leave their graves at night to suck the blood of sleeping humans, but the term also applies more generally to unscrupulous people who prey on others.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-03-06T06:59:59Z,15,15.0,False,2021-03-06T04:09:20Z

The landform I will analyze is Delicate Arch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Some of the special conditions and factors that influence the development of landforms in deserts include erosion, the presence of joints within the rocks, and desert storms.</p>
<p>2. The role of running water, erosion and deposition in Arches is that erosion is what helps create the beautiful arches seen across the landscape of the national park, and the running water may change to create a natural bridge which is another type of landform found in this park. As for how these factor influence Delicate Arch, this arch was created by erosion and by joints being created in the lower potions of the rock which made the lower potion weaker and eventually collapse, leaving the arch we see today.</p>
<p>3. The role of wind in shaping both the park and Delicate Arch is that it helps shape the rocks and natural formations found in the park by blowing debris such as sand and smaller rocks which slowly chips away at the landforms. This sometimes causes the landforms to collapse if they are too weak.</p>
<p>4. There is some evidence of alluvial fans by the natural wasting of ancient streams, though I do not see any evidence of playas. I know there are alluvial fans because there used to be strong streams flowing through the park.</p>
<p>5. There are buttes and mesas by the natural rock formations caused by wind patterns and erosion. I know this because of the wind patterns seen across the park and the mesas seen in photographs.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-08-09T05:59:59Z,19,19.0,False,2021-08-04T15:09:42Z

Based off the first image, the presence of jointing is shown in the straight lines along the rock and at the base that form the joint between the rock and the ground. Chemical weathering can be seen by the changing of colors within the rock. This is evidence that different forms of chemical weathering took place. Physical weathering can be seen by the difference of texture on the surface of the rock. Overall, weathering is very evident in this photograph.</p>
<p>2. Based off the second image, the lines shown in the rock provide evidence for both vertical and horizontal joints in this region. Also present is another variety of colors in the rock that provides evidence of chemical weathering. Also evident is the presence of physical weathering which is shown in the unique rock formation throughout this valley. Physical weathering can also be seen in the various holes in the rocks.</p>
<p>3. Based on my understanding on the formation of arches, the lower portions of a sliver of sedimentary rock can become weakened and collapse which exposes the stronger and more resilient rock above, forming an arch.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Comparison: One major similarity between these two events is the speed at which the flow of materials is coming. Also noteworthy is the amount of material being moved towards the viewer. One major difference between these two events is that the debris flow was full of dirt and stick, whereas the flash flood was just a large amount of water coming in at a very fast pace.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Opinion: If I had to experience either of these events, I would choose to encounter a flash flood because it would be easier to navigate and there are survival tips on what to do in that specific event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Strategies:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. I would stay calm to prevent getting stuck in any debris or objects that can't be seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. I would identify any landmarks to help me identify my location in case I need to call someone to rescue me.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Finally, I would look for objects to grab on to that would potentially allow me to stay above water and hopefully pull myself out.</p>

For my first observation, I chose to analyze the time lapse of Lassen National Forest and Volcanic Park in California. One of the first major changes I noticed in this time laps was the massive deforestation that took place in 1992 and 1993. It seems as in that calendar year, a third of the trees were cut down for human use, or for the purposes of urbanization. The next major change I noticed took place in 2003 where structures, most likely homes, began to be built in increasing numbers until 2012 when there are now hundreds of structures. One consequence I could see these major changes having on the landscape in the change in the natural wildlife's ecosystem. When that large of a portion of trees is removed from a forest, animals such as birds need to re-shelter to survive.</p>
<p>2. For my second observation, I chose to analyze the time lapse of the Oakland Bay Bridge in San Francisco, California. Although there wasn't any massive changes at one time during the time lapse, one major change I saw that gradually took place was the number of industrial structures being built on the west side of the Bay. I believe they are either warehouses or shipping yards because of the size and shape of the buildings and where they are located. One positive consequence I think could occur as a result of this change is major economic growth because of the new transportation route being created for the shipping yards with the bridge linking the two sides of the Bay together.</p>
<p>3. For my third observation, I chose to analyze the time lapse of Fort McMurray in Alberta, Canada. In the beginning of the time lapse, no noticeable changes took place. However, once the turn of the century took place, it seemed as if Fort McMurray went from a tiny farming community to a major industrial powerhouse for mining and farming. Large tracts of land were transformed from green fields to agricultural or industrial warehouses built for providing materials in bulk to the masses. One consequence I can see occurring in the future is the change in the region's climate. Since there is now a lack of greenery in the area, the potential for wildfires or storms could increase because of the dramatic changes.</p>
<p>4. For my final observation, I chose to analyze the time lapse of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The landscape started out as a basic coastal desert with no sight of any metropolitan areas. However, over time, shipping lanes and a large number of building began to show up and made Dubai into a a global industrial powerhouse. One consequence I can see happening due to this dramatic change is the growth of opportunity for labor and markets because of the new found oil fields, I am assuming since that is what this region is known for.</p>
<p>5. In conclusion, I have determined that the most dramatic change that took place out of these time lapses is Fort McMurray because of the complete transformation it had from just a large green area to a massive industrial region. I believe that some places change more than others because of new found economic opportunities, dramatic increase in population density, and changing economic statuses among diverse populations. Some of the biggest impacts I can see coming out of these changes include changes in natural ecosystems, increase in a regions' gross domestic product (GDP), and political strife due to rapid expansion and land rights.</p>

The latitude, or the measurement of how North or South a location is, of Draper, UT is approximately 40.5247 degrees North, whereas Tonga has a latitude of 21.1790 degrees South.</p>
<p>2. As Earth gets farther away from the Sun, the tilt of the Earth's axis makes it so the portion of the planet tilting away from the Sun, December 21st for the Northern portion and June 21st for the Southern portion, has more daylight hours, which means more heat, whereas the opposite happens for the wintertime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The tilt of the Earth gives places that are significantly North of the Equator, or the central latitude line of the Earth, more hours of sunlight as the Earth gets closer to the Sun.</p>
<p>4. Since the Earth is tilted towards the same place all throughout its revolution around the Sun, during the June Solstice, the time of year when the Northern part of Earth is tilted most toward the Sun, the Northern portion of Earth gets more energy. Vice verse with the Southern portion of Earth during the December Solstice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Since the Earth is tilted towards the same direction at all times, when Summer starts up on June 21 in the Northern half of Earth, days are much longer. However, in the Southern portion of Earth, since it is tilted away from the Sun, the days are much shorter. The complete opposite occurs on December 21.&nbsp;</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-07-05T05:59:59Z,15.5,15.5,False,2021-06-30T02:07:25Z

<p>Near the beginning of the film, one of the guests was talking about <strong>folding&nbsp;</strong>and how it can show the formation of various regions. The same guest used the&nbsp;<strong>minerals </strong>to identify when and how the rock was formed. The narrator informs the viewer that&nbsp;<strong>continental division&nbsp;</strong>made it so New York is no longer a massive mountain range as it would have been if&nbsp;<strong>Pangea&nbsp;</strong>hadn't divided. Professor David Elliott, when examining the history of the Grand Canyon, discusses a lot about the effects of <strong>weathering</strong> that shaped the rocks found in modern day Grand Canyon. He discusses wind patterns and how&nbsp;<strong>erosion&nbsp;</strong>made it possible for the footprints of ancient wildlife to be preserved.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The film discusses how the rocks on the palisade side of the Hudson River formed by&nbsp;<strong>cooling&nbsp;</strong>and also how the&nbsp;<strong>joints&nbsp;</strong>within the rocks made it so the cooling process could be completed. They were formed by the insertion of&nbsp;<strong>magma&nbsp;</strong>and the volcanic ash made it so the global climate was altered significantly. Another concept discussed in the film is the <strong>Mid-Atlantic Region&nbsp;</strong>where the volcanic vents are constantly pushing out magma that then cools and forms fresh new rock.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The dormant volcano found in Bolivia contains&nbsp;<strong>veins&nbsp;</strong>of silver that are worth a lot of money and are mined by locals. There is steam emerging near the volcano and the water is coming from the Pacific Ocean nearly 400 miles west. The film also discusses&nbsp;<strong>subduction&nbsp;</strong>when discussing the source of the silver in the mine and how the water traveled from the Pacific Ocean to the Andes.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was really interesting to learn about the lithium reserves in Bolivia and how lithium is used to make efficient batteries for electric vehicles. The film also discusses how&nbsp;<strong>subduction&nbsp;</strong>made it possible for the lithium deposit to be so abundant in Bolivia when the Andes started to form. The film also discusses the rich <strong>biodiversity&nbsp;</strong>found in the Amazon Rainforest thanks to the Andes' creation. The unique ecosystem found in the Amazon showcases how the continental divide made it possible for&nbsp;<strong>biodiversity&nbsp;</strong>to exist and for new species to exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The film also discusses hot llamas adapted to the environment of the Andes and how they were introduced to the harsh climates of Bolivia. It was also really interesting to see how the land bridge, now known as Central America, was formed and made it possible for species to mingle and create a much more diverse biosphere in both North and South America.</p>
<p>Overall, I really liked this film because it helped me apply my knowledge to natural geological processes and helped reinforce what I already knew before taking this course. I feel like the examples shown in the film also helped me remember that the concepts we learn in the textbook can be applied in the real world. It was really interesting to learn how both North and South America formed and what they would have formed if Pangea didn't divide. I also enjoyed how the film showed how modern day cultures were formed by the division of Pangea.</p>

The Mineral Cycle is the most important biogeochemical cycle to learn when trying to understand algal blooms in Utah Lake.</p>
<p>2. The Mineral Cycle uses gaseous pathways to help elements, such as phosphorus, move from bedrock to soil, and along sedimentary routes. This helps the cycle of elements continue through the ocean and ground water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Humans are implicated n the algal bloom problems on Utah Lake by the fact that our waste water treatment plants discharge certain chemicals and elements that can occasionally slip out and the only way we can prevent this from happening is to either stop the chemicals before they reach the water, which is expensive, or to fight the chemical buildup with chemicals that kill the harmful elements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Utah Lake is connected with other waterways in the state through connection routes such as the Jordan River than connect Utah Lake with the Great Salt Lake.</p>
<p>5. Algal blooms on Utah Lake could effect other waterways in the state by a trickle down effect where the harmful chemicals or elements could go down stream or be transported by some other way and effect the water supplies of neighboring communities.</p>
<p>6. According to the article on ksl.com, the algal bloom has resulted in high mortality rates among fish, bat, and bird populations.</p>
<p>7a. According to the article on wired.com, ""One solution would be for cities to upgrade their sewage treatment plants to remove nutrients before they ever hit the water."" The article goes on to explain the fact that this solution is expensive and requires a lot of planning. This solution seems to be the most straight forward and would be a good investment long term. However, one concern relating to this solution is the fact that taxpayers may want to put their money towards more pressing issues that have a more substantial impact.</p>
<p>7b. Also on the article on wired.com, ""some [cities] choose to algae-killing toxic chemicals like copper sulphate into lakes or add clay that binds up phosphorous at the bottom."" This seems to be a more cost-effective approach and would also provide a more immediate solution. However, there could be side effects from using toxic chemicals, such as poisoning caused by inhalation of those chemicals by lake-goers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7c. One final solution could be a balance between the two previous proposed solutions. County and State officials could work with lawmakers and city-planners to create a robust system of filtration and insertion of algae-killing chemicals that would not pose a threat to living organisms in the surrounding waterways and also reduce the number of toxins being introduced by wastewater treatment plants. This approach could be both cost-effective and harmless.</p>

My average water use was 1,173 gallons/day and the national average is 1,802 gallons/day so I am well below the national average.</p>
<p>2. Listed below are three aspects of my water use that are high:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a. I tend to drive quite a bit and that makes it so I need to gas up more and use my care fluids much more often.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b. I sometimes takes two showers a day and that doubles the amount of water I use in my home.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c. Because I tend to drive quite a bit, I tend to wash my car about 3 or 4 times a month which means I use a decent amount of water to wash my car when it may not be necessary.</p>
<p>3. Water use should be a concern to citizens and policy makers in Utah when we are in a serious drought because water is the source of all life and if we run out, it will have a massive impact on our economy, the lives of citizens, and industries.</p>
<p>4. The chances of me changing my water use habits is very low because I currently don't use very much water and my impact on the amount of water we currently have is not large. The only thing that would compel me to change is if I see sufficient data suggesting that Utah as a whole is critically low on water and if I don't change my habits, lives could be put at risk.</p>

My Mom: She doesn't really pay too much attention to climate change, though she does like to do her part in helping to prevent it such as not idling her car whenever possible. She thinks the main causes of climate change is pollution and natural disasters. She believes that internal combustion engines are what causes the majority of climate changes, as well as factories burning oil for manufacturing. She thinks that the current political opinions on climate change are not necessary.</p>
<p>2. My Dad: He doesn't pay attention to climate change whatsoever. He'll read some news articles about major issues relating to climate changes, but not much else on the topic. He also believes that pollution and natural disasters are the primary causes of climate change. He thinks that the causes of climate change in contemporary society are mainly mining efforts and factories that burn crude oil.</p>
<p>3. My Grandpa: He watches the news a lot and does his part in preventing climate change by recycling, walking whenever he doesn't need to drive, and driving a fuel-efficient car. He believes that cigarette smoke and forest fires are the primary causes of climate change. He believes the primary causes of climate change in contemporary society are pollution produced by cars and factories burning crude oil.</p>
<p>Comparison: The opinions of my family members don't differ too much from the general opinions of the average American. The participants I interviewed were on par with the normal opinions Utahns have on this issue. Every person I interviewed have immediate access to media that provides them with correct information and no myths were mentioned. The myths found on the Skeptical Science website helped provide me with relevant and updated information that I can use in the future to help me understand the facts behind climate change. I could help other learn more about climate change through this website by giving them correct information and direction towards reliable sources.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-07-19T05:59:59Z,27,27.0,False,2021-07-16T01:40:26Z

<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p>Analytics is used in nearly every industry ranging from major retailers to professional sport franchises. Over the past several years, an investigation has been conducted into the Houston Astros, a Major League Baseball (MLB) team who has found recent success, into their use of analytics. In professional Baseball, pitch signs are used between a pitcher and catcher to communicate how the pitcher should throw the ball (e.g., fast ball, curve ball). The investigation concluded that, “the team’s staff and players developed an illegal approach to stealing pitch signs from catchers that helped hitters anticipate what pitch was coming.” (Davenport, 2020)</p>
<p>To put this issue into context, “MLB rules allowed a runner standing on second base to steal signs and relay them to the batter, but the MLB rules strictly forbade using electronic means to decipher signs.” (University of Texas, McCombs School of Business, n.d.). During the investigation, it was found that the organization created an algorithm to predict pitch signs, thus violating the rules.</p>
<p>Eventually, the MLB found the algorithm and ended up fining the Astros’ $5 million dollars and stripping them of multiple draft picks.</p>

However, it also comes with the caveat of unintentional bias and bad data wrangling. As mentioned in the article, Data Engineering is arguably the most tedious part of Data Science and there have been many attempts to automate this, but to no avail. Rather, companies invest in Data Engineers to work alongside Data Scientists and ML Engineers to gain a better understanding of what data needs to be where and how it should be formatted. Cloud AutoML could help with this process by using Large Language Models to generate data models based on the business needs, identify data quality issues, and preprocess data accordingly. There will likely be issues regarding computing costs and requirements for stakeholders to disclose basic statistical measures with their shareholders, though this will be solved with time.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2023-12-07T06:59:59Z,50,50.0,False,2023-12-05T20:02:34Z

<li>B-trees are an indexing method used by relational databases to quickly sort through vast amounts of data stored in a clustered index. Rather than storing data in heaps that force the database query engine to refer to the IAM every time it wants to locate a record, it uses a B-tree to logically identify the data attached to the index key.<br>B-trees dramatically improve the performance of queries by sorting the data logically in each node as a traditional page&nbsp; of data. This enables the query engine to use the B-tree to find the specific value rather than iterating through all pages for a specific item.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>Other database query methods are less valuable because they force the query engine to scan a heap of data, or an unordered list of pages, to find a specific piece of data matching the query being executed. This then cuts the performance in half because the query engine must reference the IAM every time it wants to locate a specific piece of data.</li>
<li>B-trees must change over time because the underlying table data changes over time. If all customer records with a CustomerID between 100 and 200 are removed, then a node on a B-tree stating “100-150” or “150-200” will become obsolete, thus becoming a waste of space. To cope with these changes, B-trees constantly update the nodes and pages of data as new data is added and removed from the table.</li>

<p>2. Sports betting apps such as DraftKings and FanDuel allow users to place a series of bets (known as a&nbsp; ""parlay"") on various stats related to players' performance. Users are currently at a disadvantage because they may not be statistically literate or have access to historical data about a certain player's historical performance metrics in a given season. For my project, I plan on building and deploying a web app that allows users to access near real-time stats and probabilities to enhance their understanding of how the NBA works and how each statistics is measured and its meaning. This is good for Sports Betting apps because if their users feel like they have a shot at winning, they will continue using the app, leading to increased ad revenue and potential subscriptions depending on the app's pricing model.</p>

Citizen of a Community: From the viewpoint of a citizen of a community, to be ""Statistically literate"" means that the citizen understands how to interpret quantitative reports and communicate the information with someone in the community who may not be statistically literate. The importance of being statistically literate lies in the fact that exabytes of data are being produced on a daily basis around the globe, thus allowing governmental agencies and organizations to generate thousands of reports related to crime rates, tax spend, and education expenses. In order for the average citizen to understand the information found in these reports, they must be statistically literate. These reports are also critical for political campaigns and are the baseline for making healthy societal change.</p>
<p>1. (b). Business Context: In a business context, being ""statistically literate"" means that a member of an organization understands how to interpret quantitative reports for the purpose of increasing financial earnings, improving production efficiency, and lowering organizational expenses. The importance of being statistically literate lies in the fact that with the increasing amount of data being generated by businesses, leaders and employees within a business need to understand how to interpret these data and how it impacts their respective roles and responsibilities within their organization. One of the universal requirements to be an effective senior manager in 2022 is quantitative literacy. This is another term for being statistically literate, and it holds the same importance.</p>
<p>2. When statistics is described in the numerical aspect as ""numbers with social context"", I interpret that to mean that large amounts of data are being computed, manipulated, and analyzed in order to drive business value and make positive, or sometimes negative, social impact. When considering this in a business context, the meaning changes in the sense that the social context applies to the operational and administrative aspects of a business rather than how the data can impact political issues.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2022-09-07T05:59:59Z,10,10.0,False,2022-09-06T20:32:21Z

Given the insights from 21 and N3mbers, I would agree with the notion that once the game show host opens the door, you have two choices with two odds: keep your choice and have a 50% chance of success, or change your choice and have a 66.7% chance of success. Although the number of doors is the same, the probability changes based on the variables at hand. Since we know that only one of the doors has the car, the variable changes from 1/3 to 2/3 by the variables changing in dimension.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2022-10-07T05:59:59Z,10,10.0,False,2022-10-05T16:49:43Z

From my experience, I believe that basic reasoning skills and common sense will always trump hard data analyzed using statistical methods. This is because human instinct is something computers will most likely never be able to replicate and adds another dimension to effective decision making. Though I also believe statistical analysis is very useful for validating facts and supporting big decisions.</p>
<p>2. Beff Jezos Inc. has been conducting an anonymous study among their employees to identify correlations between gender and productivity. There are approximately 1,500 employees at Beff Jezos Inc. and 300 employees participated in the survey. The sample included 80% women and 20% men.</p>
<p>3. Although this study may be biased in both proportions and what goal is trying to be achieved, I believe that the outcome will show that there is little to no correlation between gender and productivity. This is positive because the management team who is in charge of this study can then share the results and promote the idea that all genders are equal when it comes to workplace productivity. Although this can be taken out of context, it has the potential to be a force for good.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2022-11-04T05:59:59Z,10,10.0,False,2022-11-03T16:58:47Z

I was also strongly involved in brain storming and problem solving sessions where we tried to solve various problems during the semester. I worked with my team members well when it came to collaborating on each challenge and consistently asking if I could help with anything.</p>
<p>McKenzie - I believe McKenzie also deserves 100% because she worked very well with everyone and contributed immensely with every project. She was the primary delegator and project manager. She was very good at delegating and following up on tasks.</p>
<p>Eva - I believe Eva also deserves 100% because she was very helpful in communicating with the members of her organization who were helping us with the final project. She was also a very strong communicator when it came to generating new ideas and solving various problems during the semester.</p>
<p>Josh - I believe Josh deserves 95% because although he contributed a lot and did his part, he did miss a few meetings and joined the team a few weeks later into the semester.</p>
<p>Nate - I believe Nate also deserves 95% because he contributed a lot, though he didn't seem to contribute to the thought process or problem solving sessions.</p>
<p>Matt - I believe Matt deserves 100% because he went above and beyond with helping others with their tasks and was very involved in every meeting.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2022-12-11T06:59:00Z,48.8,48.8,False,2022-12-05T21:00:49Z

Companies will pay to subscribe to your monthly newsletter because they are looking for new and innovative ways to market and sell their products. You might consider including the following topics in your newsletter: how to address the audience in advertisements, how to effectively use visuals and graphic design, how to successfully use different types of advertisements, and how to test marketing success with target markets.

<p><br><br></p>
<p><strong>Audience: </strong><span>Our audience comprises marketing managers at large to small businesses, sole proprietors, and chief marketing officers (CMO). Marketing managers are the users for any type of purchase that the company makes regarding marketing efforts. As users, the marketing managers will be the ones who begin the problem recognition process. Once marketing managers recognize our service fixes their problem, thinking of new and innovative marketing strategies, they will most likely need permission from their buyer, the CMO in most cases, to complete the purchase of our service. As such, we must be aware the CMO’s will also be part of our audience. Sole proprietors are both the user and the buyer but it is probable that their budgets will be different than the larger companies. As such, the message directed at sole proprietors should be adjusted, where possible, to meet their financial needs.&nbsp;</span></p>

One can simply go through the motions without a care in the world as to the meaning of it all. Asking questions has always been the best outlet for an individual to both gain knowledge and wisdom in their pursuit of happiness, yet it seems as though our contemporary society deems this action as prohibited. The topics that were discussed during class today, specifically those surrounding mercy and justice, help me become more self-aware of the intentions and consequences of other people's actions and how they effect my reactions to those situations. As an individual who is no stranger to questioning long-held ideas and political beliefs, I believe it is more critical now than ever before to question the reasoning behind public opinions and controversial topics that seem to have no perfect or definite answer so you know what you believe in and what goals to set in the future.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-06-29T18:00:00Z,5,5.0,True,2021-06-29T21:45:21Z

Although what we are taught in school makes sense to us now, looking back it could turn out to be our teachers' opinions rather than a basis of historical facts. The reality is that we may never know what is true or what is false. We need to figure that out on our own. The idea that we are allowed to think for ourselves but are forcefully encouraged to go along with societal norms is scary to think about in a country that was literally built on independence. I really liked the discussion we had in class today because it helped me share some of my very strong and unpopular opinions about our nation's current political status and cultural norms that maybe shuld be left behind.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-07-01T18:00:00Z,5,5.0,True,2021-07-01T21:48:28Z

As Josh mentioned at the end of the breakout room, normative realism limits social change because if a culture is tolerant with what is happening, no problems will be solved. Sometimes, it is ok to not respect someone's beliefs in order to make change. It is possible to be ""diagonal"" as far as being a descriptive relativist and a normative realist because it is possible to be a republican but still agree with some democrat beliefs.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-07-08T18:00:00Z,5,5.0,True,2021-07-08T21:45:41Z

One takeaway I got from class today was the idea that cause and effect is not entirely accurate. For example, just because a tornado strikes a town, it does not cause ALWAYS the residents to evacuate. The DCT is a very intriguing argument that I personally believe is inaccurate, as does Socrates, and will use this newfound knowledge of how an action or nature can cause a state of being to help interpret life events and philosophical ideas.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-07-13T18:00:00Z,5,5.0,True,2021-07-13T21:43:01Z

At this moment, I am completing my General Studies and it sometimes feels as if almost none of these courses will be of any concrete use in my career in the near future. However, when I look at the habits and principles I am learning by taking these courses, I can apply the principles I have learned, such as time management, humility, and patience, to help me in achieving my goals.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-07-15T18:00:00Z,5,5.0,True,2021-07-15T21:41:34Z

I've been thinking of this dilemma, whether humans are innately selfish, ever since I took a psychology class during my sophomore year of high school and have been thinking about special-case scenarios. For example, would a person that has down syndrome or Autism be able to know if what they did was a good deed or gave them pleasure in some form. These thoughts are what keep me up at night because I know that there may never be a definitive answer.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-07-20T18:00:00Z,5,5.0,True,2021-07-20T21:43:19Z

On one hand, people rather be assertive and ""get the job done"" regardless of any emotional harm or distress that could take place. Whereas on the other hand, other believe people should be more passive and maintain a ""don't ask, don't tell"" mentality. From my perspective, utilitarianism has a great foundation in that it promotes good will and helps people make decent decisions. However, where it seems to come up short is the cultural aspect, sometimes people do things because they have to, whether for survival or religious purposes. I learned today that no one on Earth will ever have identical opinions.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-07-27T18:00:00Z,5,5.0,True,2021-07-27T21:43:52Z

What I will take away from class today is that society almost forces you to abide by one set of rules or another and if you can't choose, then you will be making all the wrong choices for all the wrong reasons. However, on the other hand, the theory of maxims that we discussed introduced me to the idea that there is always a simple process to rationalize our thinking processes to maintain an equilibrium in our moral duties. Whenever we universalize our various maxims, it gives us more opportunities to think and grow in our philosophical realm.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-07-29T18:00:00Z,5,5.0,True,2021-07-29T21:44:06Z

Feminism has been quite the controversial topic for the last several decades and has led to some major societal reforms. from my perspective, the feminist perspective on philosophy helps introduce the notion that women and men need to be treated equally in every sense of the word. Whether in medical studies or drug testing, women and men are different. It was really interesting to see the perspectives of my classmates and I will certainly apply the principles of care and justice learned in class today into my life.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-08-03T18:00:00Z,5,5.0,True,2021-08-03T21:45:15Z

I have taken a strength finder tests that lists 120 attributes in order from strongest to weakest based off a series of about 220 questions regarding specific situations. This test helped me realize what I am capable of in a given situation. However, after today's discussion, I believe that character traits are a combination of internal and external factors that make a very big impression on our personalities. The arguments presented in class helped me think more about the various personality tests I have taken and consider whether the specific traits I have identified as who I am are just an illusion or are a matter of fact.</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-08-05T18:00:00Z,5,5.0,True,2021-08-05T21:33:55Z

What do evolution and ethics have in common? How has ethics evolved with societal changes?</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Basic Question: On pg. 76, the text states, ""Naturalists… argue that at least some ethical questions can be studied just as we try to answer questions in other fields of scientific study."" By this, does the text imply that Naturalists believe some ethical questions already have been answered through evolution?</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observation: On pg. 77, the text explains the difference between methodological and metaphysical studies of ethical and philosophical questions. This introduces the notion that not only are there different viewpoints surrounding various ethical dilemmas, but there are also different ways of studying these different viewpoints. This can cause an even sharper divide between opponents on a controversial topic involving moral or ethical disputes.</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Critical Thinking Question: On pg. 78, the text explains the difference between natural and artificial selection. Are social concepts and ideologies such as racism and sexism a form of artificial selection? If not, then are they a form of natural selection?</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Argument: On pg. 79, the text explains how Eugenics programs, ""were explicitly based on claims derived from evolutionary theory."" These claims assume that evolutionary trends surrounding natural selection can be accurately predicted. This is not the case, even in the modern scientific era. Therefore, Eugenics programs should not be morally acceptable in society.</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Basic Question: On pg. 80, second full paragraph, Does the text imply that Moore's Challenge proved evolutionary ethics wrong?</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observation: On pg. 80, last paragraph, the text is explaining the difference between establishing moral rules and establishing were moral rules apply. This inspired me to think about who in particular establishes the criterion for when and how moral rules should be applied. It seems like there are so many potential scenarios in which certain moral rules could be applied that it would be impossible to make a ""rule book"" identifying when to apply certain moral rules in a given situation.</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Critical Thinking Question: On pg. 81, the text states, ""The hypothesis [of evolutionary ethics] is that morality is a tool for cooperation."" In societies where cooperation may be limited or impossible, such as Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia, how can evolutionary ethics be applied?</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Critical Thinking Question: On pg. 83, in the box titled, ""Cultural Evolution"", the text introduces the notion that we follow social norms because we have been taught to follow them. However, why are some individuals naturally inclined to be rebellious against social norms?</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Basic Question: On pg. 84, the text expounds on the notion that moral facts may be objective or subjective. Will there ever be moral facts? Are there any moral facts present in today's society that are universally accepted?</span></li>

<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observation: On pg. 505, last paragraph, Doris seems to imply that it is a moral fact that contemporary sees people as having either good or bad characters. This is interesting considering that some people with good characters can have a ""change of heart"" and commit vicious crimes or misdeeds. </span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Critical Thinking Question: On pg. 506, Doris bluntly states that, ""people typically lack character."" If this is the case, then how does an individual develop a character? How can one know when they have or don't have a character?</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Argument: On pg. 506, Doris states that, ""Aristotle thinks that virtue is typified by the performance of right actions in the most difficult and demanding circumstances"" However, virtue must then be perceived as also performing the right actions in the lightest and least demanding circumstances This then implies that for an individual to be virtuous, they must perform the right action at all times, which is not always possible. Therefore, Aristotle's argument is false.</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observation: On pg. 506-507, Doris explains the Aristotelian perspective that shows personality traits can be associated with specified characteristics and actions of an individual. This would then support the notion that an individual's character is subject to change through life events.</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Critical Thinking Question: On pg. 515, Dories states, ""Aristotle insists that for an action to be considered truly virtuous it must be determined by the appropriately developed character of the agent."" By this, is Aristotle implying that we know an action is virtuous because of our character? If so, what if we don't know we we're doing in a given situation?</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Basic Question: On pg. 515, Doris refers to the term ""inner states"". In the context of situationism, what does this term mean?</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observation: Based on the information found in the last paragraph on pg. 515, it seems as if Doris argues that we need to invest more into our individual impact on our environment rather than our personal character traits.</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Critical Thinking Question: On pg. 516, Doris states, ""Reflection on situationism has an obvious benefit in deliberation: it may serve to remind us that, for people like us, the world is a morally dangerous place."" Why does Doris consider this world to be a morally dangerous place?</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observation: Overall, raised on this reading, the argument between character traits and innate societal norms brings up great points and valid arguments that helped me put into perspective my impact on my environment.</span></li>

<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observations: A common theme I have identified in this passage, as shown on p. 3, is the idea that if you don't know the original source of the information you receive concerning a controversial matter, your opinion will be invalid because you are just interpreting the words of a secondary source who may not have all the information themselves, or may be biased. </span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Basic Questions: On p. 3, when Plato is speaking with Calias about his sons, he asks Calias that since his sons are human, ""whom are you thinking of placing over them? Is there anyone who understands human and political virtue?"" By this, is Plato asking who Calias would allow to parent his son? Is he asking him who he would trust to be a godfather or the like over his posterity? </span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Arguments: At the very end of p. 4, Plato is contemplating a question regarding the wisdom of an unnamed acquaintance. He states, ""Well, although I do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am better off than he is—for he knows nothing, and think that he knows."" I argue that although knowledge is power, knowledge is just one piece of the intellectual spectrum whereas the individual may be better off than Plato in regards to emotional intelligence. </span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Basic Questions: In the first half of the primary paragraph on p. 5, what does Plato mean when he says, …""by the dog I swear!""?</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Critical Thinking Questions: On p. 6, Plato states, ""And I am called wise, for my hearers always imagine that I myself possess the wisdom which I find wanting in others;"" Is Plato implying that he is not wise? Why does Plato use the word 'imagine' when explaining why his hearers believe in his wisdom?</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observations: On p. 8, in the last paragraph, Plato is asking Meletus a series of questions and it seems as if he is putting words into Meletus's mouth since Meletus has no opportunity to respond, at least from the reader's perspective. </span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Critical Thinking Questions: On p. 9, when Meletus is speaking before the judges, just before the last paragraph, he tells the judges that ""[he] swear by Zeus that [Plato believes in no Gods] at all."" Why is Meletus telling Plato his own beliefs? Why is Plato having to defend himself for having his beliefs forced upon him?</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Arguments: In the first sentence on p. 11, Plato says that someone who calculates their chances of living or dying is not good for anything. However, if life is all about taking risks, wouldn't that force us to naturally calculate our own chances of survival?</span></li>

<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observation: When speaking about moral realism, as stated on pp. 8-9, the author describes the existence of baseline ethics that make up human rights and common sense. However, the author never goes into detail as to who established these baseline ethics, such as ""rape is wrong"", and how they have changed over time.</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Basic Question: On p. 2, the author introduces the different types of moral behaviors.

<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Critical Thinking Question: As the author has described the various type of moral behavioral types, as seen in pp. 8-10, what moral behavior is most present in the United States? Does it vary from state to state? Has our moral viewpoint as a whole changed over time?</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Critical Thinking Question: In the section where the author discusses normative relativism, p. 10, is it possible for an individual to believe in not casting their moral beliefs on another culture while still believing in the more subjective descriptive relativism? How would an individual be capable of holding multiple moral viewpoints at the same time?</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Critical Thinking Question: When speaking on the problems present within moral diversity, as states on p. 11, the author mentions that ""moral disagreements also tend to be more profoundly observed </span><span style=""font-style: italic; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">between </span><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">culture rather than </span><span style=""font-style: italic; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">within </span><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">cultures."" Are there various cultures being represented in the United States? Does this make our country morally diverse?

<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Argument: I have noticed that when the author is giving examples of different moral behaviors, they are using generalized statements about how certain groups view different situations. For example, on p. 11 when the author is giving an in depth analysis of what moral relists believe, I have a strong belief that anyone who identifies as a moral realists can also identify as a descriptive relativist depending on their circumstances, political beliefs, and stage of life. Therefore, claims as to what moral realists believe should not be generalized, rather specified to a degree.</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observation: I have noticed, particularly in the section describing moral diversity on pp. 11-12, that relativism is dependent on what an individual knows regarding a culture's beliefs or rituals, yet some individuals who conform with one culture but live in a country dominated by a different culture, wouldn't their moral beliefs be altered to conform to their newfound culture?

<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Critical Thinking Question: On p. 219, the author claims that, ""outsiders can, in principle deliver perfectly good indictments—only, it usually takes more than two weeks."" In this context, how long does an individual need to be involved in a culture to make a ""good indictment""? How involved does the individual need to be in the cultural activities and customs?</span></li>

<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observation: On pp. 218-220, the author seems to be in an argument with themselves about whether or not moral isolationism is actually possible.

<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Critical Thinking Question: On p. 221, the author states that, ""We could not condemn oppression and insolence if we thought that all our condemnations were just a trivial local quirk of our own culture."" If the United States in undergoing a cultural transformation, such as the cancel culture movement, how can an individual not condemn oppression when there is no real culture being represented?</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Argument: On p. 221, the author argues that, ""neither discipline nor devotion Is very popular in the West at present"" I don't know when this passage was written, though I do know that our culture encompasses the power of the individual's rights to fight for a cause until changes have been made (e.g., the Black Live Matter movement, LGBTQIA+ Movement).</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observation: On pp. 221-222, the author makes very bold and generalized statements about how western culture is presently not committed to the ideals of discipline and devotion and that consent is a western ideal only.

<p>1. Critical Thinking Questions: On pg. 28, the text states, ""Virtue ethicists tend to see ethical principles as being inherent in the world and as being discoverable by means of rational reflection and disciplined living."" Does this imply that virtue ethicists believe their are a few foundational ethical rules and several others that apply to certain circumstances? If so, how does one come to discover the ethical rules that apply to certain circumstances?</p>
<p>2. Critical Thinking Questions: Also on pg. 28, the text states, ""Aristotle believed that our purpose is to pursue our proper human end,&nbsp;<em>eudaimonia,&nbsp;</em>which is best understood as human flourishing or living well."" What is Aristotle's definition of living well? Can a person live well without being happy?</p>
<p>3. Argument: On pg. 28, in the section discussing Aristotle's views on <em>eudaimonia,&nbsp;</em>it seems as if Aristotle believes that if one lives a virtuous life, they will have guaranteed happiness. If this was the case, then human suffering would not cause a person to not have happiness. Therefore, living a virtuous life does not guarantee happiness, it just improves the chances of achieving happiness.</p>
<p>4. Observation: On pg. 28, the text implies that Aristotle believes that living a virtuous life guarantees happiness. However, it does not mention human suffering and his views on how that can hurt the chances of achieving human happiness.</p>
<p>5. Basic Questions: On pg. 29, the text states, ""The cultivation of virtue must be accompanied by a cultivation of rationality."" What's the difference between virtue and rationality? How does a person cultivate rationality?</p>
<p>6. Critical Thinking Questions: On pg. 29, the text states, ""The virtuous act is the one that falls between the extremes [in a decision-making situation] of what is deficient and what is excessive relative to the situation."" Who or what determines the virtuous act in a given situation? Are there multiple virtuous acts that can take place in a given situation?</p>
<p>7. Observation: On pp. 28-30, the text implies that making virtuous decisions and participating in virtuous acts is an individual choice, rather than a societal or cultural norm. This is interesting considering there are laws in place that states what you can or can not do in a particular situation (e.g., the ""Stand Your Ground"" laws).</p>
<p>8. Observation: On pg. 31, the text implies that Aquinas's views on ethics and rationality have a lot in common, yet Aquinas focused more on the religious side of things rather than the contemporary. It seems that both of these philosophers have very good perspectives on ethical issues and rationality, yet their perspectives almost seem to contradict each other in a given real-world situation.</p>
<p>9. Basic Question: On pg. 32, the text states, ""The universals abstracted by the mind from multiple individuals..."" What does the term ""universal"" refer to in this context? Is it referring to universal truths?</p>
<p>10. Critical Thinking Question: On pp. 32-33, the text states, ""The law of karma says that thoughts and actions that intend to harm others will eventually cause harm to ourselves..."" Does this imply that an equal level of harm will come to the individual?</p>
<p>Nicomachean Ethics Book 1/2:</p>
<p>1. Basic Question: On pg. 41, Aristotle states, ""Every craft and every line of inquiry, and likewise every action and decision, seems to seek some good..."" How does every action or question 'seek some good' if there are some actions that are exclusively intended to harm?</p>
<p>2. Basic Question: On pg. 42, Aristotle states, ""And [this good] appears to be characteristic of political science."" What is Aristotle referring to this this context? Has the definition of political science changed since Aristotle's time?</p>
<p>3. Critical Thinking Question: On pg. 42, the text states, ""if the good is the same for a city as for an individual, still the good of the city is apparently a greater and more complete good to acquire and preserve."" How are the goals and achievements of a city or state government more important than those of an individual?</p>
<p>4. Observation: On pg. 42, Aristotle determines that ""it is finer and more divine to acquire and preserve [the glory] for a people and for cities."" From my perspective, the city-states on ancient Greece and Rome were so important that individual goals and achievements seemed to be overruled by the conquests achieved by the city-states.</p>
<p>5. Critical Thinking Question: On pg. 42, Aristotle states, ""hence the good judge in a given area is the person educated in that area..."" If this is the case, then why are modern-day judges not placed into situations in which they are educated (e.g., a judge with a background in business be involved in judging white-collar crimes)?</p>
<p>6. Observation: I find it very interesting that Aristotle argues on pg. 42 that a youth ""is not a suitable student of political science; for he lacks experience"" because in today's society, 18-year-olds have the right to vote, yet they have very little experience in life and may be voting for things that may not have any impact on them for several years.</p>
<p>7. Observation: Aristotle brings up a good point on pg. 42 when he compares the differing views on happiness between ""the many"" and ""the wise"". Put simply, he states that the many believe happiness to be subjective to their circumstances, whereas the wise believe there to be a general good from which all other goods, or happiness, comes from. This seems to still be the case in today's society where ""the many"" want short-term satisfaction, and ""the wise"" believe there to be a source of long-term happiness.</p>
<p>8. Argument: On pg. 43, Aristotle states, ""things are known in two ways, for some are known to us, known without qualification."" However, there are situations where we convince ourselves that we know something, yet we don't know anything about the topic or situation. Therefore, there are a three ways in which things are known.</p>
<p>9. Observation: Throughout this passage, it seems as if Aristotle is a very black and white thinker, meaning he views things as either a or b, rather than there being multiple other possibilities. One example of this is on pg. 43 when he states, ""He who grasps everything himself is best of all; he who is noble also who listens to one who has spoken well; but he who neither grasps it himself nor takes to heart what he hears from another is a useless man.""</p>
<p>10. Basic Question: On pg. 43, Aristotle states, ""if this is the sort of life [a person] leads, no one would count him happy, except to defend a philosopher's paradox."" What is a philosopher's paradox?</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-07-15T16:00:00Z,5,5.0,False,2021-07-15T15:56:42Z

<p>1. Basic Question: On pg. 37, it describes the theories of psychological egoism, ethical egoism, and social contract theory. How does a person come to know what position they hold?</p>
<p>2. Critical Thinking Question: On pg. 37, the text states, ""Self-sacrificial behavior... cannot disprove psychological egoism because people who sacrifice themselves are not motivated by altruistic concern."" In this context, is it possible for someone to be both selfish and altruistic in a given situation?</p>
<p>3. Observation: On pp. 37-38, I have noticed that the various views on psychological egoism are very black and white: either a philosopher believes that we are selfish at all times, or that we are selfless at all times.</p>
<p>4. Argument: On p. 38, the text states, ""It is very unlikely that one can know for certain how much one's own motivation is of egoistic concern or of altruistic concern."" However, whenever we do some thing good or bad, we consciously know the reason why we committed such an action. Although we may never think of the reason(s) nor admit them verbally to another individual, we still are aware of our motivations to conduct certain actions.</p>
<p>5. Critical Thinking Question: On p. 39, the text states, ""[Adam Smith] argues that mutual kindness is necessary for happiness."" In this context, what is mutual kindness? How can mutual kindness be achieved?</p>
<p>6. Observation: On pp. 39-40, it seems like altruism is either viewed as good or evil, there isn't too much gray area. Even today, altruism isn't clearly stated as something we should strive for or something that should be avoided.</p>
<p>7. Basic Question: Smith and Rand seem to have opposing views on ethical egoism. In today's society, is psychological egoism or ethical egoism more prevalent?</p>
<p>8. Critical Thinking Question: On pp. 41-42, the text describes Social Contract Theory as a way to help prove the fact that we should coordinate with others in society. However, is this same view held in every society? If not, what other views are held in various societies?</p>
<p>9. Basic Question: On p. 42, the texts states that the Social Contract Theory is based upon social conventions that have been agreed upon. Who created these social conventions? Are they written anywhere?</p>
<p>10. Critical Thinking Question: On p. 42, the text states, ""the real problem is whether moral requirements as social conventions... ensure that everyone does obey."" With this in mind, Why is there such a majority of people in the United States not getting vaccinated? Vaccination campaigns have had great success in the past, so why not now?</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-07-20T16:00:00Z,5,5.0,True,2021-07-20T19:22:53Z

<p>1. Basic Question: On pg. 53, first paragraph, the text says, ""[Kant's] style of ethics is referred to as deontology."" Is Kant one of the founding figures of this style of ethics or has deontology been around for hundreds of years?</p>
<p>2. Critical Thinking Question: On pg. 53, second paragraph, the text explains that the word ""imperative"" in Kant's categorical imperative is a command or order that comes from within. Do we create these commands ourselves? If so, do these commands vary between individuals and cultures?</p>
<p>3. Observation: On pg. 53, when the text is explaining the similarities and differences between hypothetical and categorical imperatives, it seems as if Kant's perspective on morality is very black and white, it's either hypothetical or categorical, not much in between.</p>
<p>4. Argument: On pg. 54, the text states, ""If the maxim can be universalized, meaning that it's possible that everyone could live by it, then it's permissible to follow it."" However, what this does not account for is those individuals who may not have the mental or emotional capacity to think rationally for themselves. For example, an individual with down syndrome may not have the ability to make rational choices based on their own conscious because of learning disabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Critical Thinking Question: On pg. 55, the text states, ""The type of rational approach to ethics that Kant prefers will downplay the importance of consequences due to this unpredictability."" Based on the assertion that consequences are unpredictable, is it possible to accurately predict the consequences of a given action each time it occurs based on past experience with pursuing the action?</p>
<p>6. Observation: Based on the information provided on pp. 55-56, it seems as if Kant's perspective on morality has turned from black and white, to that of interpretation. By this I mean to say that his opinions are open to interpretation rather than a matter of fact.</p>
<p>7. Basic Question: On pg. 57, third paragraph, the text states, ""Concerning acting out of love and compassion, Kant believed that when people act due to their emotions, then their emotions are in control, not their rationality."" Does Kant believe that if we make decision based on emotions, then we did not make the decision rationally?</p>
<p>8. Critical Thinking Question: On pg. 57, Kant states, ""a person with dignity deserves respect and shouldn't be treated as a thing."" Following this assertion, there have been many times throughout history where dictators treated their followers as things, yet has there ever been a dictator that turned out to be a highly successful and enduring leader?</p>
<p>9. Observation: Based on the points presented by both the text and Kant on p. 58, Kant seems to be a human rights activist when he explains the notion that we should treat people simply as ends, rather than a means to an end.</p>
<p>10. Basic Question: On pg. 60, first paragraph, when the text states, ""Perhaps, by treating oneself as a mere means, one is not treating oneself with respect—as a person with dignity and with unlimited value."", does this mean that if we have low self-esteem, we are being immoral? If so, when is an individual being moral if they are constantly depressed?</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Groundwork:</span></p>
<p>1. Critical Thinking Question: On pg. 102, the text states, ""Each of us has a compelling reason to obey morality even when doing so only frustrates our deepest desires."" In this context, how does one define their reasoning behind obeying morality?</p>
<p>2. Basic Question: On pg. 103, in the middle of the first full paragraph, Kant uses the term ""rational spectator"" when talking about good will. What does Kant mean by this term?</p>
<p>3. Observation: On pg. 103, in the last paragraph, Kant is explaining how an individual can corrupt the power that morality possesses by not using good will. This brings to mind the phrase, ""With great power comes great responsibility."" Just because a person is doing the right things, if their intention is to gain something in return or to do something evil later, then they have corrupted their own morality.</p>
<p>4. Basic Question: On pg. 104, in the first full paragraph, Kant says, ""Even if, by a special disfavor of fortune or by the niggardly provision of a stepmotherly nature..."" What does Kant mean when he uses the terms 'niggardly' and 'stepmotherly nature'?</p>
<p>5. Argument: On pg. 105, in the first paragraph, Kant gives an example of a merchant setting equal prices during a ""good deal of trade"". Kant argues that by setting fair prices, the merchant is acting in self-interest. However, although the merchant may be looking to earn as much money as possible, they may also be trying to not rip-off their customers. Therefore, the merchant is not acting in pure self-interest.</p>
<p>6. Critical Thinking Question: On pg. 105, in the middle of the last paragraph, Kant states, ""[a person finds] inner satisfaction in spreading joy around them and can take delight in the satisfaction of others so far as it is their own work."" However, during the holiday season, isn't it traditional to spread joy whether you made the cookies or gifts or not? If so, then why does Kant argue that we can only spread the joy that we produced?</p>
<p>7. Observation: On pp. 106-107, Kant seems to be implying that good will and rationality are separate but equal in the sense that one can make a decision out of good will and have it be rational or make a decision out of good will and have it not be rational because of emotions that come into play.</p>
<p>8. Basic Question: On pg. 108, Kant states, ""Since every practical law represents a possible action as good and thus as necessary for a subject practically determinable by reason..."" What is Kant's definition for&nbsp;<em>practical law</em>?</p>
<p>9. Critical Thinking Question: On pg. 109, Kant states, ""There is, therefore, only a single categorical imperative and it is this: act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law."" How does someone force their maxim to become a universal law? Does a person need to simply wish for it or does the maxim need to be voted upon by a general consensus?</p>
<p>10. Basic Question: On pg. 109, Kant starts to explain various ""duties in accordance with the usual division of the, into duties to ourselves and to other human beings..."" Did Kant simply make up these duties or have these been prescribed by former philosophers and authors?</p><script src=""https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10120000000000016/attachments/118357416/CanvasJavascriptMobile.js""></script>",1,,2021-07-29T16:00:00Z,5,5.0,True,2021-07-29T18:58:12Z

With the difference being the fact that utilitarian's ""[act] according to the rule… because, if widely accepted and followed, will produce the most good."" Does this uphold the idea that a federal vaccination mandate would be morally correct?</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observation: On pg. 47, in the first full paragraph, the text gives multiple examples that explain the difference between actual consequence utilitarians and foreseeable consequence utilitarians.

<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Basic Question: Based off the information found on pg. 65, were there no female philosophers in the early Twentieth Century?

<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observation: The text states on pp. 65-66 that men focus on the principles of justice and responsibility whereas women focus on the principles of relationships and kindness.

<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Argument: On pg. 66, Carol Gilligan claims that, ""a woman exhibits a focus on caring for the self in order to ensure survival…"" After analyzing this statement, I have determined that both males and females act in self-interest before helping others for the reason of survival. If this were not the case, females would be the only humans alive. Therefore, both males and females act according to Care Ethics.</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observation: On pg. 67, the text explains the principles of natural care and ethical care as introduced by Nel Noddings. These principles seem to be very similar to those of Utilitarianism, where the individual needs to make decisions based on what will best fulfill the happiness, or care, of others.</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Basic Question: On pg. 67, the text states that, ""In service occupations, such as a flight attendant, Bartky says the employee must force their own feelings into the background, and be nice (for example)…"" Does this imply that Feminism is wrong in assuming that only women have the capacity to care for others on a deep level in this environment?</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observation: Based off Bartky's argument on pp. 67-68 regarding women's role in the household, it seems like the role of women has changed dramatically as many women are now entering the workforce and allowing the fathers to take care of their children.</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Argument: On pg. 68, The text states, ""Women and girls are taught to take pride in the production of [children, household maintenance, care of children and men, and sex], while men learn that these are women's work, and therefore not their responsibility. I personally grew up with a stay-at-home dad who was responsible for taking care of my brother and I as well as completing household maintenance.

<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observation: On pg. 70, the text explains the notion that modern-day feminism in philosophy encompasses the idea that autonomy doesn't mean entirely independent, it simply means independent but with the ability to ask for help when needed.

<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observation: On pp. 417-41, Lindemann explains the process of how an individual forms their own identity and how their identity if formed for them. This seems to be slightly subjective as in today's world of social media and constant propaganda, an individual's identity can be forced upon them by society.</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Argument: On pg. 418, Lindemann states, ""if families impose identities on their children that stunt their emotional, intellectual, or physical growth… unless the children later manage to contest and repair these damaged identities, their lives will go badly for them."" There are many stories of individuals who were abused as kids or grew up in environments where their parents weren't great influences, yet they still were able to turn out alright or be outright successful. Therefore, if families impose negative identities on their children, there is no guarantee the children will be unsuccessful in life.</span></li>

<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observation: On pp. 418-419, Lindemann explains that our identities are shaped and maintained by various aspects of our lives, including our homes, neighbors, and material possessions. This seems to be a very fundamental part of the human experience, to know one's self as accurately as possible. The perspective on one's identity may change, but their true identity will never change once it has been fully developed.</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Critical Thinking Question: On pg. 420, Lindemann explains the notion that to properly portray another person's identity, the proportions need to be set right.

<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Critical Thinking Question: On pg. 420, Lindemann explains the notions that if we classify an entire group of people around a single identity, we are going against the social norms of morality.

<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Critical Thinking Question: On pg. 421, Lindemann shares the example of the grandmother with Alzheimer's who is being taken care of by her granddaughter and son.

<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Observation: On pp. 420-421, when Lindemann is explaining the notion of good and bad holding of a person's identity, it has become clear that we hold many identities on a daily basis, when we call our parents or grandparents, when we do an act of kindness to our next-door neighbor.</span></li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; vertical-align: middle;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">Basic Question: On pg. 423, Lindemann explains society's role in holding identities.
